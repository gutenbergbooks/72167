<p class="p2">March 20.—Lady Hester rose about three in the
afternoon, and went into her garden: I joined her
about five o’clock. Spring had already begun to display
its verdant livery. The weather was exceedingly
fine, and every bush and tree seemed to have swollen
with sap, buds, and leaves, so that the eye could perceive
a palpable difference even from the preceding day.
The birds were singing on every branch (for nobody
dared to molest them in this sacred spot), and the
bulbuls sat warbling a low but gentle music, which,
now and then, was broken in upon by their clear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
whistle, falling in cadences on the ear like sweet
concords. It was one of those hours which a man,
who feels himself in the decline of life, or gradually
sinking under disease, would most regret, in thinking
that the harmony of nature must soon close on him
for ever.</p>

<p>Lady Hester had placed herself in a small white
alcove, which closed the vista at the bottom of a walk.
A sofa, covered with marone-coloured cloth, with
flowered chintz cushions, ran across the back of the
alcove. On this she was leaning; and, being dressed
in her white <i>abah</i> with its large folds, she looked
exactly like an antique statue of a Roman matron.
Half way up the avenue stood an attendant in a handsome
white Nizàm dress, which is exceedingly becoming
to youth, waiting her call. As I advanced towards
her, between two hedges—the one of double jessamine
in full bud, and the other of the bright green <i>pervenche</i>,
or periwinkle-plant, with its blue flowers,
forming an azure band from one end to the other, I
was struck with the magical illusion which she ever
contrived to throw around herself in the commonest
circumstances of life.</p>

<p>As I approached, she addressed me with more cheerfulness
than usual. “Do you know, doctor, that
Prince Pückler Muskau is come to Sayda, and has
written me a very agreeable, and what appears to be a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
very sincere, letter. Read it, and say what you think
of it.” Translated, it was as follows:</p>


<p class="p2 center">
<i>Prince Pückler Muskau to Lady Hester Stanhope.</i><br>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right r2">
March 20th, 1838.<br>
</p>

<p class="indent2">My Lady,</p>

<p>As I am aware that you are but little fond
of strangers’ visits, from having often found they proceeded
from idle curiosity, and sometimes even from
more illiberal motives, I freely confess, madam, it is
not without some degree of apprehension that, in my
turn, I solicit permission to pay my respects to you.
Permit me, nevertheless, to assure you that, for many
years past, I have anticipated in fancy the pleasure of
knowing you, and that it would be a downright act of
cruelty on your part, if now, when the long wished-for
moment is at last arrived, you should refuse me
the happiness of paying my homage to the queen of
Palmyra and the niece of the great Pitt.</p>

<p>Besides, madam, I have the presumption to add
that, from what I have heard of you, there must exist
some affinity of character between us: for, like you,
my lady, I look for our future salvation from the
East, where nations still nearer to God and to nature
can alone, some one day, purify the rotten civilization
of decrepit Europe, in which everything is artificial,
and where we are menaced, in a short time, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
new kind of barbarism—not that with which states
begin, but with which they end. Like you, madam,
I believe that astrology is not an empty science, but
a lost one. Like you, madam, I am an aristocrat by
birth and in principle; because I find a marked aristocracy
in nature everywhere. In a word, madam,
like you, I love to sleep by day and be stirring by
night. There I stop; for, in mind, energy of character,
and in the mode of life, so singular and so dignified,
which you lead, not every one that would can
resemble Lady Hester Stanhope.</p>

<p>I close this letter, which already must appear too
long to you, in earnestly entreating you not to set
down as mere expressions the dictates of a heart artless
and ingenuous, though old. I am neither a
Frenchman nor an Englishman: I am but an honest
and simple German, who perhaps lies open to the
charge of too much enthusiasm, but never to that of
flattery or insincerity.</p>

<p class="right r2">
[Signed] <span class="smcap">Prince of Puckler Muskau.</span><br>
</p>

<p>PS. Should you consent to my coming, might I
presume to beg of you still farther to allow me to
bring Count Tattenbach, a young man in my employ,
who would be so much hurt to see me set off without
him that I am induced to risk the request! Although
severely wounded from a pistol-shot, he would not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
remain at Acre, for fear of losing the opportunity of
paying his homage to you: nevertheless, your will,
my lady, and not mine, be done in everything.</p>
</div>

<p>When I had finished reading the letter, Lady
Hester resumed: “Now, doctor, you must go and see
the prince at Sayda, for I can’t see him myself. The
fatigue is too great for the present; but I will engage
him to return again when I am better. I could wish
you to say many things to him; for I can see that he
and I shall do very well together: besides, I must be
very civil to him; for he has got such a tongue and
such a pen! I think I shall invite him to come and
see the garden and the horses; but you must tell
him the mare’s back is not only like a natural saddle,
but that there are two back bones for a spine; that is
the most curious part.—But no! if he comes it will fill
my house with people, and I shall be worried to death;
it will only make me ill: so I’ll write to him after
dinner.</p>

<p>“What I would wish you to talk to him about
is principally the serpent’s cave. You must tell him
that, at ten or twelve hours’ distance from Tarsûs,
there is a grotto, where once lived an enormous serpent
with a human head, such as he may have seen in
paintings representing the temptation of Eve. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
serpent was possessed of all the skill in demonology
and magic known on earth. There was an ancient
sage who was desirous of acquiring this serpent’s
wisdom, which he knew could be come at by destroying
the serpent: he therefore induced the king of the
country in which the grotto is situate to enter into his
views, and, by the king’s orders, the neighbouring
peasantry were assembled for that purpose. The sage,
who had given instructions that, in killing the serpent,
they were to proceed in a particular manner, and that
the head was to be reserved for him, stationed himself
not far off: and when the peasants went as usual to
carry his food, intending to seize a proper moment for
effecting the destruction of so formidable a reptile, the
serpent, being gifted with the power of speech, said,
‘I know what you are come for; you are come to take
my life. I am aware that I am fated to die now, and
I shall not oppose it: but, in killing me, beware how
you follow the instructions which the wicked man who
sent you gave—do exactly the reverse.’ The peasants
obeyed the serpent; and, doing precisely the reverse of
what the sage had enjoined them to do, the king too
died, and thus met the reward of his treacherous conduct.
Since that time no other serpent has appeared
with a human head, but several are living in the same
grotto, and they still are fed by the neighbouring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
villages, which send the food at stated times, and the
people have opportunities of seeing them with their
own eyes.</p>

<p>“You must tell the prince that this story is perfectly
authentic, and that, since the time of Sultan
Mûrad down to the present day, certain villages are
exempted from taxes in consideration of providing
sustenance for the serpents. As he naturally must
wish to inquire into and see so remarkable a phenomenon,
you may tell him that, if he puts himself into
a boat, he can land at Tarsûs or Swadéya, and thence
find his way a few hours’ distance farther, where the
grotto is.”</p>

<p>I hung my head during the whole of this story,
reflecting what a pretty errand I was going upon—to
tell with a serious air a story so devoid of probability,
and so likely to strengthen the supposition, common
in England and elsewhere, that Lady Hester was
crazy. She observed my ill-concealed incredulity, and
bawled out rather than said, “Do you understand
what I have been telling you? I suppose you’ll tell
me I am mad. Do you believe these things or not?
why don’t you answer?” As I remained mute, she
said, “Well, will you repeat them to the prince as I
have related them?” I answered, “Yes, I would do
that.”—“But there,” said she, “go to dinner now,
and come again in the evening: I suppose you are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
thinking more of your soup getting cold than of anything
else.”</p>

<p>It was now sunset, and I found my family waiting
dinner for me: but that was a very common occurrence,
and excited no surprise. Having dined, I returned
to Lady Hester. She was in the drawing-room,
and she immediately renewed the subject of the
grotto.</p>

<p>“The king’s name,” said she, “was Tarsenus—he
gave the name to Tarsûs, or took his from it, I don’t
know which. You must not forget to speak to the
prince likewise of the dervises’ monastery, called Sultan
Ibrahim, which is near Tripoli. He has only to
present himself there, and use my name; they are all
like my brothers; they have many learned men
amongst them: if he wants a letter to them, I’ll give
him one. As for the Ansaréas, the Ishmäelites, the
Kelbëas, and all the sects on the mountains between
Tripoli and Latakia, he will get nothing out of them;
so it is of no use his trying. If he returns to Jerusalem,
beg him not to extend his excursions towards
the back of the Dead Sea, or beyond the Jordan; for,
as he is known to be a friend of Mahomet Ali’s, some
Arab behind a rock may pick him off, just out of
spite to Ibrahim Pasha.”</p>

<p>Lady Hester went on. “Did you perfectly understand
what I said before dinner about the serpents?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
“Not altogether,” I replied. “Perhaps,” she observed,
“you don’t like to go down to the prince?” I replied,
anxious to seize any excuse for getting rid of the serpent
story, “I can’t say I have any particular wish
to go.”—“Why,” said Lady Hester, “you have done
nothing but talk about him for these last five months;
what was that for, if you don’t want to see him?”—“I
talked about him,” answered I, “because I thought,
from what I had read of his works, you would be
pleased to see him, if he came this way?”</p>

<p>Lady Hester paused a little while, and then proceeded:—“Well,
doctor, look here—you will talk
a great deal about the serpents, and, when you can
see a proper opportunity, and that nobody is likely
to hear you, you will say to the prince in a low voice,
‘Lady Hester recommends you to make some inquiries
about the serpents’ cave<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> when you are at Beyrout;
for near to Tarsûs is <i>Kolôok Bogàz</i>, where Ibrahim
Pasha’s army is encamped: you will probably like to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
see it, and this will be a good excuse, as everybody
then will fancy you had no political motive for going
there.’”</p>

<p>The mystery was out; for two or three months
Lady Hester had been introducing the story of the
human-headed serpent into her conversations; for two
or three months she had known of Prince Pückler
Muskau’s coming; for the same period I had entertained
apprehensions that her reason was impaired:
M. Guys had been primed in the same way, and
formed the same conclusions; and all turned out to be
one of those long-laid plots, for which she was so
famous, to save the prince from being considered as a
spy in the dangerous neighbourhood of two hostile
armies.</p>

<p>It had happened some years before, when the
prince’s letters on England were first translated, I,
being in London, had noticed the work in a letter to
her, and had copied out a few observations on herself
made to the prince by a Hanoverian gentleman.
Subsequently, when with her, I had spoken of the
prince’s increasing reputation as a literary man, and
mentioned such particulars of him as had come to my
knowledge. All this, and his alliance with the family
of Prince Hardenberg, with whom Lady Hester had
been acquainted, increased her desire to see him: but
how to accomplish it now was the difficulty. The few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
hours she spent with M. Guys had done her a great
deal of harm; for, being obliged to exert herself, and
not being able to treat a guest as unceremoniously as
she could me, the exertion proved too much for her
strength. “Englishmen,” she said, “are fond of
turning everything into ridicule, and of saying spiteful
things of me; with the French and foreigners in
general, it is not so: and with a man of the world,
like the prince, I have nothing to fear on that score;
but then how am I to lodge him and accommodate
his people and his dinners, with a wretched cook
and nothing of any sort fit for a man of rank! No,
doctor, it will not do: so sit down, and write and tell
him so.”</p>

<p>The following letter was the result. It was in
French; but, as her ladyship’s French was sometimes
worded without much regard to genders and tenses,
although in her expressions nobody could be happier,
it will be better to give a translation.</p>

<p>I trust, Prince, you will believe me when I say, I
am overwhelmed with regret that my health will not
permit of my having, at this moment, the honour of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
making the acquaintance of a philosopher and a philanthropist
such as you are. You may ask everybody
whether, for these last five months, I have seen
a single soul, excepting Monsieur Guys once; and,
although, in that once, I every now and then retired
for a few moments to my room to recover myself, and
then returned to him again, yet, after he was gone, I
had a relapse for some days. I would willingly purchase
at the same price the pleasure of seeing you;
but, in doing so, it might incapacitate me for some
months longer from managing a very disagreeable business
that has sprung up between the Queen, the
English government, and myself; they pretending to
meddle with my affairs, which, be assured, is what I
will not allow.</p>

<p>As my natural energy would not suffer me to converse
tranquilly, when things sublime and of the
highest importance would be our subjects, we must
give up meeting each other for the present; but I console
myself with the hope that your Highness will not
leave Syria, until I have had an opportunity of appreciating
a man, different they say from other men, and
of making the acquaintance of your young Count, who,
in devoting himself to your principles, necessarily
secures one’s admiration of his character.</p>

<p>PS. If you go to Damascus, do not neglect, in
your way, to stop at a village named Hamâna, where
Sultan Mûrad once halted. A very extraordinary
and interesting story is attached to his stay there.
Farther, do not forget to see the place at Damascus,
where the Forty Sleepers (<i>Welled el Kaf</i>) and their
black dogs are entranced: they will awake at the time
that we are looking forward to.</p>

<p>I send my doctor to you, who is a very good sort
of a man, but is no philosopher, like you and me. He
can give you some little information on certain curious
things in the north of Syria, which no traveller has
yet investigated.</p>

<p>This letter was despatched by the government
estafette, who had brought the prince’s letter; and it
was settled that I should pay the prince a visit this
morning after breakfast, for it was now two hours
after midnight.</p>

<p>March 21.—But just before setting off, Lady
Hester altered her mind. An answer had come from
Beyrout to a note I had written to Mr. Forster, saying
he should reach Sayda on the 21st, at night, and
leave it on the 22nd in the morning. It therefore
suited better to combine two objects, and pay both
visits together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span></p>

<p>Prince Pückler Muskau, in the mean time, was unwilling
to leave Sayda without a positive assurance
from Lady Hester Stanhope that she would see him
within a short time. Towards sunset, another estafette
came, with a second letter from him, which, however,
she did not suffer me to see. She merely said,
“Doctor, the Prince won’t be put off; he renews his
solicitations, and consents to go to a distance, and return
again at the end of a week or ten days: so
we must write him another letter.” This was as
follows:</p>

<p>I find your highness to be a great philosopher, but
nevertheless a very unreasonable man. Is your
object, in coming here, to laugh at a poor creature,
reduced by sickness to skin and bone, who has lost
half her sight and all her teeth, or is it to hear
true philosophy? Alas, at this moment, a terrible
cough puts it out of my power even to speak during
the greater part of the twenty-four hours. But I
will not be stubborn; and, if you will consent to put
off your visit for eight or ten days, I will receive you
then, even if my health should be no better, that you
may fulfil the object of your visit. However, I hope,
as the fine weather is at hand, and as I now begin to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
get a little sleep, which I have not done for many
months past, that I shall be able to converse with
you for some hours at a time.</p>

<p>It appears that you beg me to give you the history
of Hafânah, if it is but piecemeal; but it is too long
a one to put down on paper.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span></p>

<p>If you believe me, it is with regret that I am
obliged to cross you; but I am convinced you would
be the last man not to be sorry, if, from a degree of enthusiasm
natural to me, which would be increased in
finding in you sentiments analogous to my own, I
should become excited, and fall anew into sufferings
from which I am but just recovering.</p>

<p>Sunday, Monday, Thursday, and Friday, will be
the days most propitious for our first meeting: I
should prefer Sunday or Thursday, according to the
calculation I have made of your star and your
character: so, Prince, depart in peace; only, when
you return, write a little before, to apprize me
of it.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>March 22.—The above letter was despatched by
the estafette early in the morning, in the expectation
that it would reach the Prince time enough to enable
him to set off for Beyrout the same day. It was
settled between Lady Hester and myself, that, having
to meet Mr. Forster and Mr. Knox, I should afterwards
call on the Prince. “Then, doctor,” said Lady
Hester, “you will be enabled to give me a description<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
of his person, look, manners, &amp;c.” So anxious
was she that I should not miss him, that her manservant
was at my door at sunrise, to see that I did
not oversleep myself, although it was past three o’clock
in the morning before I had retired to bed. Fatigue
and want of rest were thoughts that never crossed
her active mind, or, if they did, she pretended to forget
them. Half an hour after sunrise I was on horseback,
and on my road to Sayda.</p>

<p>The morning was beautiful. The shelving sides of
the mountains, across which the path lay, just began
to show forth the blades of corn with which they were
generally sown. The birds carolled; the goats were
browsing on the rocks; the village girls, with their
water-pitchers on their heads, models of elegance for a
statuary, were going slowly in groups to the spring.
Not a breath of air, and not a cloud disturbed the
serenity of the atmosphere. Before me an active lad,
as walking groom, according to the custom of the
country, led the way, with a pace as light as the
antelope’s.</p>

<p>The road, with various windings, from a height of
some five hundred feet above the level of the sea,
descends, after a two hours’ ride, to the river Ewelly,
where, on crossing a bridge of no very ancient construction,
the traveller enters the orchards of Sayda,
which continue, for a distance of another hour, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
the gates of the city. Close by the bridge stands a
rude caravanserai, where travellers halt for a cup of
coffee, to smoke a pipe, or, when the gates of the
city are shut, which is always at two hours after sunset,
to pass the night. A soldier or two may be
generally seen squatted on the broad stone bench, or
<i>mustaby</i>, as it is called, in front of the caravanserai,
or khan, the more common name. These military
loiterers are not such idlers as they seem, for they
come here to watch for deserters, keeping a keen
look-out upon all passengers that arrive by this road,
and exercising, in fact, the scrutiny of a vigilant
police, although with such apparent carelessness that it
would be impossible for strangers to suspect their object.</p>

<p>Near the khan, about fifty yards higher up the
river, is a water-mill, on the flat roof of which may
be seen wheat just washed and spread out to dry,
previous to being ground, and dozens of donkeys,
with sacks of wheat or flour on their backs, coming
and going to and from the mill and the city. Clumps
of oleander bushes are scattered over the alluvial parts
by the river side, and mulberry-tree plantations cover
its banks.</p>

<p>I received a quiet <i>salâam</i> of recognition from two
or three persons as I passed on; for here I was
better known than I should have been at the same
distance from my native place. Over the bridge the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
road turns short to the right, and follows the seashore;
an upper road inclines to the left, along the
foot of the mountain, the track for those who would
proceed to Tyr without entering Sayda. The space
between the two, which is thickly covered with orchards
and gardens, in the widest part may be nearly
half a mile broad. The Mediterranean presented an unruffled
deep blue expanse of waters, with here and there
a <i>shakhtoor</i> lying as still on its bosom as in a picture.</p>

<p>Under the old and venerable sycamore, which I now
remembered for five and twenty years, sat some peasant
women, resting themselves on their way from the villages
to the city, whose brown and uncovered bosoms
contrasted unpleasantly with their intelligent and fine
features and their white teeth. But they were bearers
of heavy loads, and field-labour and the heat had made
restraint irksome to them. Now and then a beautiful
girl of fourteen or fifteen might be singled out from
among them, whose well-turned ancle and finely-shaped
foot, where not an inequality disfigured the beauty of
the toes—whose rounded arm and taper fingers, with
a form and face all Eastern, and her chemise buttoned
with a little coquetry high up the neck—with her
white pantaloons embroidered at the ancles, and silver
rings round her legs and wrists—would arrest one’s
attention, whilst the action of drawing her veil closer
to her face seemed to signify that the passing glance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
of admiration had not escaped her. Farther on, a long
train of Druze women, known by the horns on their
heads, from which their long veils, half crape half
cotton, were suspended with more graceful folds, were
seen winding along the sands, on their way to the
Mountain, probably the harým of one of the numerous
emirs or princes who inhabit Mount Lebanon. As I
passed them they carefully drew their veils across their
faces, and peered at me from one eye<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> with all the
curiosity belonging to their sex. They were mounted
on mules and asses, and their silk and brocaded
dresses, with their cloth mantles, the trappings of
their beasts, and the demeanour of their attendants,
denoted them to be ladies of some rank.</p>

<p>Passing the <i>Sebat ayôon</i>, or Seven Springs, a clear
rivulet of water which rises about a hundred and fifty
yards from the seashore—the <i>Shemaôony</i>, where is a
vaulted building enclosing the tombs of some ancient
pashas, and also, as the tradition goes, that of one of
the grandsons of Abraham—I approached the town.
Close to the gate, but still in the suburbs, are two or
three tombs held in great reverence, where some
devout Mussulmans may generally be found in the
attitude of prayer. Turning the corner by the barracks,
I nodded to the blacksmith, who for many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
years had shod Lady Hester’s horses, and entered
the city-gate. A few guards as usual were seated
on the outside, and heaps of oranges and vegetables,
the property of the gardeners, who had come with
their daily supply for sale, were scattered about in
such quantities, that it required some little attention
to steer through them, without treading on the people
who were squatted here and there on the ground in
perfect confusion.</p>

<p>I rode to the French khan, to put up my horse;
and, giving him to be tethered in the quadrangle under
the shade of some lofty trees, I directed my steps to
the house of one Lufloofy, where English travellers,
on passing through Sayda, generally lodge for the
night. For the good old times are gone by, when
consuls’ houses were open for the reception of strangers,
and the hospitality they received was thought to be
sufficiently repaid by the pleasure which the conversation
of a European, fresh from Christendom, was
thought to afford.</p>

<p>I found that Messieurs Knox and Forster had
passed through the preceding day, leaving a message
of regret behind that they were obliged to resume
their journey without seeing me. Returning after
breakfast to the French khan, I waited upon the
French consular agent, Monsieur Conti, in the hope
of learning something of the prince’s movements.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
Having satisfied myself that he would not depart
until the next day, I passed the morning very agreeably
with Madame Conti, a lady remarkable for her
conversational vivacity. A glance at the topics that
make up the conversation in a gossiping visit of this
sort in ancient Sidon may possibly afford some amusement
to the English reader.</p>

<p>“You are a very bad neighbour, Mr. Doctor: we
hardly ever see you now; and you have never yet
brought your family here. You know this house is
yours, and not ours: but then the air of the Mountain
is so pure, and the road is so bad, that I don’t
wonder at their seldom quitting it. We have had a
very charming traveller here, who called on us in his
way through—a man of most highly polished manners
and agreeable address.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>“Yes,” interrupted the husband: “I gave him
such information as I could respecting the antiquities
he would find between this place and Tyr, and I
would have procured him a guide, but the nizàm
has taken off all our idle fellows; so I advised him
to address himself to the first peasant he met
when he got near Sarfend (Sarpentum), and thus he
would be able to see a particular grotto I directed
him to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
“Oh!” said the mistress of the house, “it is that
very curious grotto, the subterranean chamber, the
walls of which are painted over with”—(I must suppress
her expression, admissible in Italian, but hardly
tolerable to English ears)—“they say that the inhabitants
thereabouts used to worship these symbols;
and even now the Ansaréas retain the same profane
worship, which has continued down to them from the
days when the inhabitants of these countries adored
Astarte. Strange indeed are these aberrations of the
human intellect! The name of the grotto is <i>Megâara
el bizàz</i>.”</p>

<p>M. Conti resumed—“The prince is not like the
English; he does not even inquire about antiquities:
he only spoke to me of Bâalbec.”</p>

<p>Some fish, fresh from the net, were brought in for
sale. The mistress, for her family, and I, for mine,
each bought two fine ones at the rate of fourpence the
oka (4lbs.). Just before, there came in a Turk, who
sat down without being asked to do so, and as soon as
there was a break in the conversation, addressed himself
to M. Conti about some property in litigation in
the cadi’s office. “That man,” said the mistress of
the house in Italian, which, of course, the Turk did
not understand, “is an <i>imàm</i>, and the cadi’s clerk:
he is talking about justice. Do you know what he
calls justice! it is this. When my husband has any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
suit, which he and the cadi have to decide, and he
comes to talk it over, I take an opportunity, and hold
up one or more fingers, as the importance of the affair
may require. He has a pretty quick eye, and he
understands the number of fingers to mean so many
<i>khyreeas</i>” (gold pieces of money) “as a present for
himself and master if the business should be settled in
our favour. If he has not been bribed higher, before
the end of the week you may be sure how the case
will go.”</p>

<p>The imàm addressed himself to me, and said that
the Syt (her ladyship) had always been accustomed
to give forty piasters a year to his mosque for charity,
and, he did not know why, for the last two years, her
donation had been discontinued. “I tell Logmagi of
it,” added he, “but he always puts me off by saying
he has forgotten to mention it: and now, when I
meet him in the street, he thinks, I suppose, that I
am going to bother him about it, and looks another
way. ‘Ya, Logmagi,’ I cry; ‘ya Hassan el Logmagi!—ya
Hassan Captàn—ya Abu Mohammed;’
and, although I use the politest appellations, they are
of no avail: he turns his head away, and pretends
not to hear me. This is very hard, for it used to be
a few piasters in my pocket: and the cadi is going to
dismiss me from my place, which is a certain two
piasters a day (fivepence), besides other little perquisites,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
in order to give it to his son, who is now
grown a young man.”</p>

<p>“Yes, poor fellow!” interrupted Madame C.; “he
picks up a few piasters by saying prayers over the
graves for the dead, by writing petitions, letters, and
so on:” then, turning to the imàm, she added,
“<cite>Allah kerým!</cite> I dare say the doctor will speak a
word for you.”</p>

<p>“<cite>In shállah</cite>—please God—he will,” ejaculated the
man. “Good, my lady! May the Almighty restore
her to health: she is the benefactress of the poor;
and, when we heard she was so ill, half Sayda was in
tears. God prolong her life!”</p>

<p>“Amen!” echoed the whole party. And the
imàm, who, hearing I was in M. Conti’s house, had,
no doubt, come for no other purpose than to try his
luck, took his leave.</p>

<p>The imàm spoke the truth. Several poor families
lived on Lady Hester’s bounty, and she subscribed to
nearly all the mosques and charitable institutions.
The old and infirm frequently received little comforts
at her hands which their own means would not enable
them to procure; and it created no little surprise that,
without any previous inquiry, she always seemed to
know the precise nature of their wants. Her presents,
too, were enhanced in value by being bestowed at the
right moment: nobody had to wait for her benevolence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
Madame Conti, the lively and loquacious lady of
the khan, had been a severe sufferer by the earthquake
of 1837. During that fearful convulsion, one of her
ancles was crushed by the fall of a massive stone.
One Abdhu, the son of a mason, and himself uniting
the double occupations of mason and bone-setter, was
immediately called in. The ancle was so mutilated
that a European surgeon would have instantly proceeded
to amputation; but Abdhu bound up the
lacerated parts as well as he could with bandages, and,
placing the patient in a damp vaulted warehouse on
the ground-floor—the only room which the earthquake
had not destroyed—confidently predicted her
ultimate recovery. Prince Joinville, happening to be
at Beyrout at the time in his frigate, very humanely
sent his surgeon to Sayda to see what assistance he
could render to the sufferers: the consul’s lady was,
of course, the first person attended to. The surgeon
pronounced his deliberate conviction that, if the leg
were not amputated, the patient must sink under it:
Dr. Canova, the Pasha’s physician, who was present,
entertained the same opinion. Poor Abdhu lay
crouched in a corner during the consultation; for his
European brethren looked upon him with too much
contempt even to recognize his presence in the room:
but, when they were gone, Madame Conti again appealed
to him, and he again reassured her. “Do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
not be alarmed,” he exclaimed; “my father and I
have cured many worse cases than this.” She followed
his advice, the European doctors making no
scruple in saying that she must pay with her life the
penalty of her obstinacy. The result proved that she
was right, nevertheless; for, at this time, March,
1838, she was in perfect health, with the prospect of
being able to walk without the help of crutches, and in
June following she became a mother. The case is a
curious one, and shows what nature can do in some
instances; but it is quite certain that, under such
circumstances, amputation would be considered in
Europe the only means of saving the patient’s life.</p>

<p>On surgery in the East, which, it must always be
recollected, is in the hands of barbers, one more anecdote
may find a place. Hassan Tirâany, a brave
Albanian soldier, and one of those who, after the
siege of Acre, found refuge in Lady Hester’s house,
once had his leg shattered by a cannon-ball. A considerable
portion of the tibia was carried away. A
Turkish barber replaced the piece that was wanting
by another piece, of as nearly similar length and
dimensions as he could, from a dog that was killed
immediately for the purpose. Union took place, the
leg healed; and, with the exception of a little deformity,
the man was as active as ever. This story
Lady Hester used to relate with great exultation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
“There!” she would say; “tell Mr. Green that, and
acquaint him with a discovery so useful to humanity.”
But it is right to observe that the man was not a
person of strict veracity; and that a little farther
doubt is thrown on the anecdote by the fact that all
Mussulmans consider dogs as unclean animals, so that
they will hardly touch them, and are, therefore, very
unlikely to consent to an osseous union with them.</p>


<div class="footnotes"><p class="center">FOOTNOTES:</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> I am indebted to the reviewer of these “Memoirs” in the
New Monthly Magazine of July last, for more accurate information
about this legend of the serpent. He says that a cave
does exist at a distance of a few hours’ travel from Tarsûs, with
which many traditions are connected; and, among others, that
of the Seven Sleepers, whom Lady Hester alludes to elsewhere.
In the same neighbourhood are to be met the ruins of a castle,
called, to the present day, the Castle of the King of the Serpents,
to which the fabulous story related by her is attached.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> Here Lady Hester Stanhope interrupted the dictation of
the letter. “You may tell the Prince,” said she, “a story
about Sultan Mûrad—a sort of Eastern tale to put in his
book. Sultan Mûrad was one day looking at the water boiling
in a pot, and turning to his prime-minister who was with
him, ‘Vizir,’ said he, ‘I wish to know from you what that
bubbling water is talking about, and I command you to tell
me.’ His manner was perfectly serious; and the vizir thought,
that by such a strange command, expressed so doggedly, the
sultan wished to pick a quarrel with him: so, after musing a
little—‘Sire,’ replied he, ‘when one of the elements is in
commotion, no doubt the master of the world would wish to
know the reason. Be patient with me: give me ten days to
interpret these signs, and I promise you I will do it.’—‘It is
well,’ said the sultan; ‘remember that in ten days I shall expect
your answer.’ The vizir retired from the sultan’s presence,
and reflected very seriously on what he had to do. ‘My
master,’ thought he, ‘is very ridiculous to set me to explain
what a pot of boiling water is mumbling to itself about: but, as
I am his slave, his orders must be obeyed in some shape. Who
knows? there may be soothsayers or magicians who understand
these things: I must find such a one out, at all events;’
and he resolved to go in quest of one. He accordingly mounted
his horse, and with a single servant set out, without well
knowing what road to take.” Lady Hester had got thus far
in her story, when she said, “But, doctor, this will take too
much time:—so let us finish the letter, and I shall perhaps be
able to relate the whole story to the Prince himself.”</p>

fleet—Khalyl Aga.</p>


<p class="p2">About noon, I went from the French khan to the
house which Prince Pückler Muskau occupied. He
was lodged in the residence of Ibrahim Nuckly, one
of the richest merchants of the place, who, by the
governor’s order, had removed his family to accommodate
his highness, whose suite was numerous. Mahomet
Ali, viceroy of Egypt, anxious to do honour
to the Prince, had given him a special firmàn, requiring
all official persons to treat him in a manner
suitable to his rank. A military officer, a Tartar, and
two or three chaôoshes, accompanied him in his travels;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
and everything was provided for him at the
Pasha’s expense.</p>

<p>These signal acts of oriental hospitality have given
occasion to some discussion amongst European travellers.
It is urged, on the one side, that such travellers
should avail themselves of these favours merely
as credentials for enabling them to procure whatever
they may require in accordance with their rank; but
that they should acknowledge all the courtesies they
receive by presents and remuneration at least equivalent
to the trouble and expense they occasion. On the
other hand, it is said that such magnificent liberality
should be accepted in its full and unrestricted sense,
anything in the shape of largess or repayment being
regarded only as a reduction from the free grace of the
original courtesy. In this latter sense, Prince Pückler
Muskau understood the viceroy’s hospitality: he took
the firmàn strictly according to the letter; and his
house, post-horses, and provisions—in short, his whole
expenditure, was defrayed by checks on the viceroy’s
treasury. The Duke Maximilian of Bavaria, Lord
Prudhoe, and a few others, who were favoured with
similar firmàns, thought otherwise: they left proofs
of their generosity wherever they went, handsomely
rewarding everybody whom they put to the least
trouble or inconvenience. It is impossible to suppose
that the Prince thought he could repay all the kindnesses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
he received by the gratitude of his pen; because
it is impossible to suppose that favours of that kind
could exert any influence over his writings. The
only conclusion at which we can reasonably arrive is
that he was proud of this distinguished feature in his
travels—namely, that of having traversed the whole
of Egypt and Syria with all the pomp of a grandee
without having expended a single farthing. The
distinction is a strange one, but it is a distinction
notwithstanding.</p>

<p>The courtyard of the prince’s house was filled with
military officers, government people, and others, waiting
to be presented; but, as soon as my name was
announced, I was ushered by his dragoman into a
handsome <i>alliah</i>, or saloon, gaily painted in Arabesque,
with sofas round three sides of the room. The remains
of breakfast were on the table. He expressed
great pleasure in seeing me, and, by his countenance
and manner, immediately prepossessed me in his
favour. He is a tall man, about fifty years of age.
I found him dressed in a loose morning-gown, with
white trousers, and a yellow scarf thrown over his
shoulders somewhat for effect, with a <i>casquette</i> on,
and having the air and demeanour of what he was—a
man of the world and of high birth. He had a
chamelion crawling about on the tube of his pipe and
on his chair; and, every now and then, the exclamation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
of “<i lang="fr">Ou donc est le caméléon? ou est mon petit
bijou?</i>” made me fear at first we were going to have a
second edition of Monsieur L—— with his lap-dog,
who, in talking to it in all those endearing terms
which the French use towards pet animals, and in
making more fuss about its food, bed, and the like,
than humanity requires, had greatly lessened himself
in the estimation of both Turks and Christians, in a
country where exaggerated and unnatural phraseology
is never applied to brute animals.</p>

<p>The conversation naturally began by inquiries
respecting Lady Hester Stanhope’s health, with expressions
of deep interest for her recovery. He next
spoke of our young queen. “<i lang="fr">Quel beau rôle!</i>” he
exclaimed, “to be a queen, and to be so lovely, so
young, so clever! and where will she find a husband
worthy of her?” A latent thought seemed to lurk in
the prince’s breast, and who knows what he felt at
the moment? Notwithstanding, of himself he said,
“I have almost made up my mind to settle in this
fine country: I will build myself a house, get what I
want from Europe, make arrangements for newspapers,
books, &amp;c., and choose some delightful situation; but
I think it will be on Mount Lebanon. However, after
I have seen more of the country, I shall be better able
to judge: for, after all, I find no country so charming
as this, and Europe is no longer the land of liberty;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
for there liberty and passports cannot exist together.”
He then told me a story of his having been stopped
somewhere in France from an informality in his passport.</p>

<p>I agreed with him most heartily on this head, and
reminded him of that liberticide, M. Guizot, who, in
a national senate, could dare to affirm that the locomotion
of individuals was subject to the will of governments.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
“Yes,” I added, “of governments such as
he would frame, it might be: but, thank God! there
are countries where sophists are not yet called to rule
over mankind. Thank God! too, that, in his infinite
wisdom, he has sent gout and palsy into the world to
hamper the legs and movements of those who seek to
trammel the industrious citizen or the enterprising
traveller, and all those honest and necessary callings,
the success of which often depends on unrestrained
freedom in change of place.” Here I stopped: but,
had I been more intimate with the prince, I would
have added—“Use your pen, good prince: it has exposed
with success some follies and prejudices in the
world; let it shame tyranny and oppression: for
never can Frenchmen boast of freedom whilst individuals
are booked and labelled from place to place,
like parcels in a diligence office.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span></p>

<p>The journal which lay before the prince caught my
eye, clearly written, and no doubt long meditated.
He spoke French with great purity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span></p>

<p>Count Tattenbach was present during the interview,
and his mild and somewhat melancholy manner led
me to suppose that her ladyship had judged rightly of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
one who had devoted himself to the prince’s service.
He was a gentleman, as I had occasion afterwards to
know, who, to a thorough acquaintance with the modern
Greek language, to high talents for music and
painting, as also to a general love of the fine arts and
<i lang="fr">belles lettres</i>, added a finished education and much instruction
acquired by travel.</p>

<p>As the prince’s dragoman had now announced two
more persons of consideration, who were waiting to be
introduced, I drew my interview to a conclusion,
although the prince was courteous enough to desire to
prolong it by ordering pipes and coffee for his visitors
in an ante-room. In the evening I returned to Jôon,
and gave Lady Hester an account of my mission.</p>

<p>Friday, March 23.—One of Lady Hester Stanhope’s
peculiarities was, that no business, however
common, could be done without a reference to lucky
and unlucky days. The season was now come for her
mares to go to grass, and strict orders were issued
that they should be taken this afternoon, just before
sunset. The field of green barley in which they were
to be placed was between Jôon and Sayda, close above
the gardens. The grooms were furnished with a tent,
a night lamp, tethering cords, and all that was necessary
for a gipsy camp, which was to last six weeks:
they were also put on board-wages. But a scene of
violent excitement was acted by Lady Hester, in consequence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
of finding that the field was rented this year
for two hundred and sixty piasters, which field four
years before was let for one hundred and thirty.
“See,” she said, “how these bailiffs waste my money,
and no one keeps watch over them, to check their
rascality: they take bribes to let others cheat me, and
nobody knows the real value of even an acre of grass.”</p>

<p>We were now again without money in the house,
the last ten thousand piasters having been spent.
No letter came from Sir Francis Burdett. Her
pension was suspended. Seven thousand piasters were
due to the people for a quarter’s wages: and, in consequence
of the reports current even in the bazàars, the
baths, and the barbers’ shops at Beyrout, that her income
had been stopped by the Queen, there was little
likelihood of her bills being negociable on London,
even for the quarter’s money arising from the legacy
of £1,500 a year, left her by her brother, Colonel
James Stanhope, which still held good. Notwithstanding
these difficulties, no disposition was manifested
by her to curtail a single expense. There were
still thirty-three or thirty-four servants, all of them
doing what three good European men and two maids
would have performed a great deal better. “For,”
she would say, “how can I turn them away now, to fall
victims to the conscription, and have to reproach myself
for their misfortunes?” But it is much to be feared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
that of all those to whom she afforded protection not one
would have remained an hour in her service, had not
that very apprehension been before their eyes: for, as
mussulmans, they could not, according to the tenets
of their religion, serve infidels. Confirmed in idleness
as they were, they hated those who set them to do
anything; and, knowing the weak points of Lady
Hester’s character—her love of the semblance of sovereignty
and of high-sounding titles, her avidity for
supposed secret news, her dislike to women in general,
and her disposition to mortify others—they flattered
her foibles, provoked her jealousies, added fuel to her
anger, and made the house a scene of trouble from
morning to night, which answered their own purposes,
by keeping their mistress constantly employed. Ill as
she was, all this rendered her worse, and my days were
literally passed in endeavouring to soothe her irritation.</p>

<p>Never was there so restless a spirit—never lived a
human being so utterly indifferent to the inconvenience
to which she subjected those, who she thought
had been remiss in their duty. Nobody could
pursue their avocations in quiet: she must give
instructions to every one. And although the unexampled
versatility of her talents and genius seemed to
inspire her with an intuitive knowledge on all matters,
yet it was irksome to remain three or four hours together
to be taught how to govern one’s wife or how to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
rear one’s children, how statesmen were made and
how ministers were unmade, how to know a good
horse or a bad man, how to plant lettuces or plough a
field, &amp;c. These lectures nobody could render more
agreeable and instructive than Lady Hester Stanhope,
if they had occurred less frequently, or if they had
always arisen naturally out of the course of conversation.
But I was the only English person with her:
she made me the vehicle of all her wishes and instructions—her
griefs and her abuse; she dictated all her
letters to me; I comptrolled her accounts and was her
treasurer; I directed her household; I read long files
of newspapers, to cull the interesting articles for her;
I had to discuss medicine with her, and was expected
to cure an incurable disease; I had to scold her maids,
and to become, if she could have persuaded me, a slave-driver:
lastly, I generally sat up with her until two
or three o’clock in the morning. All this was more
than enough to do, even with all the appliances of a
well furnished house and a well regulated English
establishment; but, exposed to the many inconveniences
that a house half furnished, a people half
taught, and materials of comfort half wanting, caused,
it is hardly to be wondered if I found my humble
abilities unequal to the task.</p>

<p>Lady Hester Stanhope’s health in the mean time
improved, whilst mine gave way. She was however<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
over-anxious about the prince’s expected visit, and
returned to her favourite idea that a large body like
hers required a great deal of substantial nourishment.
She accordingly tried to eat forced-meat balls, meat-pies,
lamb, chicken, &amp;c., and hoped to calm her
dyspnœa by spoonfuls of wine and lukewarm drinks.
During these days I was busy in perusing a file of
newspapers extending from November 23 to February
4. It was in them that we read the details of
Mr. D. W. Harvey’s motion for a committee on the
Pension List.</p>

<p>Saturday, March 25.—Lady Hester received a letter
from the Viscount Ebrington, giving her notice also
of the committee, saying he was on it, and that she
could write to him whatever she had to suggest for
securing a continuance of her pension: but the die
was already cast—she had resigned it, and she was not
a woman to retract her words.</p>

<p>Sunday, March 26.—Lady Hester sent to my family
a fine cluster of bananas, weighing perhaps twenty-five
pounds. When she saw me, she said, in allusion
to them, “I suppose you will not take any of my
presents as usual. Do as you like: but why do I
send things to your house? because in this country
nothing marks the regard one person has for another
so much as presents: and, if you hear the servants
wish to denote the thorough contempt that a sultan, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
pasha, or an emir has for any one, it will always be by
saying he did not even give him a present to the value
of a fig. In England, for example, it would be thought
strange to send a couple of loaves of sugar to another
man’s house, or a sheep, or a bag of coffee: but here
it is done every day. In the same way, presents of
clothes are very common: however, I will not trouble
you that way any more if you don’t like it. But just
tell me, when you first arrived in this country, and in
a retired spot like this, where were you to get what
was necessary to dress yourself as a Turk? it would
have been impossible.”</p>

<p>This conversation arose from some expensive presents,
which Lady Hester Stanhope had, on two or
three occasions, just after our arrival, made to me and
my family: such as some pieces of Damascus silks, a
fine abah or cloak, exactly similar to the one she always
wore, and a complete Turkish suit of clothes. I acknowledged
in return how highly we were flattered by
these tokens of regard, but requested leave to return
the pieces of silk, and professed my willingness to keep
the dress, as I could not absent myself to replenish
my wardrobe, and I knew how much she disliked the
European dress. I considered, too, though of course
I did not say so, that her finances required that nothing
should be spent unnecessarily, and I did not like
to be supposed to encourage profusion; but she refused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
to take back anything, and said she would immediately
have them burned in the courtyard, if I returned them.
There was no disputing with her, so she gained her
point. As for fruit and such things, I raised no
objection, and Lady Hester seldom let a day pass
without contributing to the comforts or luxuries of
our table.</p>

<p>It was impossible to enjoy a calm for any length of
time. In the morning, when I went to Lady Hester,
I found her greatly ruffled. The conversation that
ensued will explain the cause. “You suffer yourself,”
said she, “and I have told you so over and over again,
to be trampled on by these people; who, when they
say you are a kind-hearted man, only laugh at you.
Which do you think they like best, Logmagi, who
abuses them well, or you, who are afraid of them?—why,
Logmagi, to be sure. Captain Logmagi is genteel, is
delightful in their eyes; because masters here are only
known to be such by their severity. What did one
of my black girls, Zayneb, tell me many a time?
‘Why don’t you flog me well, if I do what you dislike?
I shall know then what you mean: but when
you are preaching to me, and what you call giving me
advice for my good, I only fancy it all a trick for some
purpose.’ There was Giovanni, your old servant, how
often did he say to me, after I took him—‘I don’t
understand all that jargon, but I know what the whip<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
means.’ Look again what they say about the prince”—(Pückler
Muskau, of whom it appears they had
heard something from the servants who had been to
Sayda)—“‘That’s something like a man—he can put
himself in a passion.’—Doctor, I can’t bear such cold
milk and water people as you are, nor can they: I am
like a hot iron—pour cold water on it, and see how
it hisses.</p>

<p>“Women formerly found something like protection
from men, and were not left alone in the world as they
are now. What! shall I have a scoundrel of a fellow,
like ——, come and stick his fingers in my face,
and ‘you’ and ‘you’ me? but I’ll teach him better
manners, or I’ll know why:—a set of beings, the slush
of the earth! <i lang="fr">des âmes viles</i>, as the prince calls them.
I told Mr. Dundas that, now-a-days, one might think
one’s self very well off, if, when some dirty fellow spits
in one’s face, what was called a gentleman took out his
white pocket-handkerchief and wiped it off, hoping
one was not hurt!”</p>

<p>The conversation here took another turn. “I wish
you,” said she, “to ask your little girl’s governess to
come in, and iron some sheets for me: do you think
she will do it? You may order Lunardi’s room to be
cleaned out for her. As for my making company of
her, you know it would be a farce: would it not? Not
that a difference of rank makes any difference with me:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
for I have seen poor people, whose natural qualities,
whose pure unsophisticated minds, whose real virtues
have made me feel myself their inferior in those
things, although so much their superior perhaps in
judgment and talents. Such people are oftentimes
preferable, in my opinion, to all those who read out of
one book and then out of another, thinking one day
according to one author, and the next day quite the
contrary: just like teapots, drizzling out of the spout
what was poured into them under the lid. As for me,
I would destroy all books in a lump. It was a lucky
thing for mankind that the Alexandrian library was
destroyed: there was good reason for what the caliph
did.”</p>

<p>March 29.—An answer to Lord Ebrington’s letter,
of which the following is a copy, was written to-day:</p>


<p class="p2 center">
<i>Lady Hester Stanhope to the Viscount Ebrington.</i><br>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right r2">
Jôon, March 29, 1838.<br>
</p>

<p class="indent2">My dear Lord Ebrington,</p>

<p>Your letter of the 26th of December reached me a
few days ago; and it gave me great satisfaction to find
you had not altogether forgotten me or my interests.
I am so ignorant of what passes in Europe, generally
speaking, that I was not aware that pensions were to
be revised. The first I heard of it was from a traveller
(Mr. Vesey Foster) having mentioned, about a fortnight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
ago, that such was the intention of Government:
but, as I did not see him, I had no opportunity of
inquiring into particulars. You tell me that you are
on the committee, and that, whatever I have to say
respecting my pension, I had better write it to you:—I
have nothing to say. You can hardly suppose that
I would owe a pension to the commiseration of a
pettifogging committee, when I refused Mr. Fox’s
liberal proposition of securing me a handsome income
by a grant of Parliament: neither should I, under any
circumstances, lower the name of my dear old King,
or my own, by giving any explanation. It was His
Majesty’s pleasure to give me a pension—that is sufficient—or
ought to be sufficient. New-coined Royalties
I do not understand, nor do I wish to understand
them nor any of their proceedings. My ultimatum
respecting my pension I have given to the Duke of
Wellington, founded on the impudent letter of Colonel
Campbell, a copy of which I enclose.</p>

<p class="right r2">
<span class="smcap">Hester Lucy Stanhope.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb">

<p>April 1.—Although the European tricks of All
Fools’ Day have no counterpart in the East, this
morning was marked by a jest, if it were one, which
was not unlike one of the dangerous practical jokes of
the West, and which very nearly proved fatal to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
object of it. Old Pierre had contrived to render himself
unpopular amongst the Christian servants by
railing at their bad faith and their indifference to
religion—abusing at the same time the mufti, the
cadi, and priests of all denominations. The Turks
swore to be revenged, and even went so far as to say
that they would murder him. Whether they intended
to execute their threat to the full is, perhaps, doubtful;
but they fell upon him in the dead of the night, and
might possibly have carried it into effect had not
Lady Hester heard his cries and sent Logmagi to
rescue him.</p>

<p>Not a word of this was breathed to me the next
morning by any one: the same mystery would have
been observed had they murdered him. It is amazing
with what perfect combination of purpose these people
keep their own counsel: you might be in the heart of
a plot for days and days, and never know anything
about it. Ever designing and ever mysterious, and
always apparently most calm and most smiling the
greater the mischief intended, they foil all your
vigilance without any apparent effort, and, like the
vampire, lull you to slumber when about to spill your
blood.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
Calling on Lady Hester about three o’clock, I found
her in the saloon, seated on the sofa, with the heavy
war-mace in her hand: it appears she had had the
aggressors of the preceding night before her. “Oh!
doctor,” said she, as I entered, “I have settled them.”
Not knowing what she meant, I asked whom, and she
briefly related Pierre’s jeopardy. “Yes,” continued
she, “my arm has some strength in it yet, weak as I
am: I have given it to them pretty well, and I don’t
think they’ll molest Pierre again.” She rose from the
sofa, and gesticulated with great force to show me how
effectually she had wielded the mace. I suggested
that she should turn the worst of them away, and
keep only eight or ten servants; for they were only a
torment to her. “Yes, but my rank!” was her
characteristic answer.</p>

<p>The rest of the day was employed in making up
two cases and two baskets, to be sent as a present to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
Khalyl Aga Kezerlý, an old acquaintance of Lady
Hester’s. They consisted of three bottles of champagne
and twelve of Bordeaux, three bottles of rum,
three of brandy, and five of different sherbets. Then
there were about twenty different remedies in case of
illness, a jar of Epsom salts, slips of adhesive plaster,
&amp;c.; and, lastly, a couple of needle-cases, with English
needles and sewing thread. This man was a Mussulman,
and the wine and spirits were for his own use:
but he would not have dared to accept them before
Ibrahim Pasha’s time; for then a Mussulman’s sobriety
was as sure as an Englishman’s veracity was
supposed to be, both which, half a century ago, admitted
not of a question in Turkey. “God knows,”
observed Lady Hester, as she was giving her directions
about the packing, “I am always thinking about the
comfort of others; but nobody thinks of mine. I am
a slave in the service of humanity, and cannot find an
atom of feeling, of sentiment, of courage, of energy, of
fidelity, or of compassion, in all these wretches by whom
I am surrounded.”</p>

<p>The conversation turned on Prince Pückler Muskau,
and she regretted she had consented to see him,
fearing she should never be able to get through the
fatigue, and apprehensive that the expense would be
greater than her present means would enable her to
undertake. After many <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i>, in which I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
could but re-echo her fears and apprehensions, which
were too justly grounded, I suggested that she might
politely decline the prince’s visit. “Oh! but, doctor,”
she answered, “his book, his book! I must see him,
if it is only to have some things written down. Is it
not cruel to be left here, as I am, without one relation
ever coming to see me? To think of the times when
the Duke of Buckingham would not even let a servant
go to order an ice for me, but must go himself and see
it brought—and <em>now</em>!”</p>


<div class="footnotes"><p class="center">FOOTNOTES:</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> Speech of M. Guizot in the <i lang="fr">chambre des députés</i>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> The general feeling of disgust and bitterness with which
all travellers, who are natives of Great Britain or of the United
States, speak of the vexations they are compelled to undergo
from the formalities and exactions to which they are subjected
in obtaining signatures to passports on the continent,
need not be dwelt upon. Much ill blood, more delay, not to
speak of expense, are created by the insolence and legalized
robbery of official persons, into whose hands the defenceless
traveller falls in the fulfilment of these formalities. Passports
are the alpha and omega of a man’s trouble on a continental
journey.</p>

<p class="footnote">In some particular cases, it may even be affirmed that the
exercise of consular authority in reference to passports amounts
to actual illegality. Captain B., an Englishman, in the winter
1836-7, was about to leave the Sardinian States, and made his
arrangements accordingly, but neglected to settle a debt which he
had contracted at a shop kept also by an Englishman. The creditor
immediately went to the English vice-consul, and requested
he would not deliver the captain’s passport until the bill was
paid: and it was accordingly stopped, although Captain B. had
taken his passage by the steamboat. This case is by no means singular;
for many English consuls consider themselves justified in
acting in the same way under similar circumstances. Now,
the question at issue is—has a consul a right to do this?
The answer will be found in the fact that no such right
is known to the English constitution, and that, therefore, the
conduct of the consul is unconstitutional and illegal. The
British government has no power over the movements of an
individual, except under the warrant of a magistrate. English
legislation knows nothing of passports, except as a usage resorted
to by foreign governments, to which British subjects
must submit while they are within the range of their operation.
But the consul, as a British officer, cannot recognize a passport
otherwise than as a formality exacted by the government of
the country in which he resides; he cannot, without laying
himself open to a serious responsibility (which it is a great pity
he should not be made to discharge) employ a passport as an
instrument for the detention or arrest (for such it amounts to,
in fact) of any free-born subject of Great Britain. Even the
British consul at Havre did not feel himself authorised to stop
Mr. Papineau’s passport on his way to Paris, although Mr.
Papineau was denounced as a traitor and an outlaw by the
British government.</p>

<p class="footnote">Captain B.’s creditor ought to have applied to the Piedmontese
police, and not to the English vice-consul, who was a
native of the place. And this is one of the crying evils of our
consular system. Instead of appointing meritorious half-pay
officers, or other deserving gentlemen, born in Great Britain,
to such offices, we frequently bestow them upon inhabitants of
the place, who are bound by religious, social, and domestic ties,
to prefer the interests of the country in which they live to
those of the country which they represent, and who hold in
much greater fear and respect the local authorities of the
neighbourhood than the distant authority to which they owe
no allegiance beyond that of official forms, which they can in
most cases violate or misrepresent with impunity. Our consular
system is open to many objections, but this is one of the
most palpable and disgraceful.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> The defection of the Ottoman fleet to Mahomet Ali and the
treachery of the Captain Pasha furnish a remarkable illustration.
One cannot but be struck with the extraordinary
fact of a whole crew’s not having, in hint or word, given the
slightest intimation to Captain Walker of what was going on.
Slight as may have been his knowledge of the Turkish language,
yet one would have supposed some expression let fall
must have betrayed their intention. He must have had servants
likewise, who, mixing with the ship’s company and with
the servants of the officers, might have heard some allusion
dropped as to the council held to deliberate on so important a
measure. But the newspapers said he was ignorant of the
plot up to the last moment: and from my own experience I can
believe such a thing very readily.</p>

of Prince Pückler Muskau.</p>


<p class="p2">Tuesday, April 3, 1838.—I have frequently been
asked this question in England—“How did Lady
Hester pass her time in the solitude of the Lebanon?”
and, if my answers were generally evasive, the reader
of these pages can have no difficulty by this time in
understanding the reason why. Another common
inquiry was—“Is she writing her memoirs?” Some
people were curious to know whether she read a great
deal; and others fancied her to be riding in oriental
splendour at the head of tribes of Arabs, or residing
in a palace, where she sat on a throne of ivory and
gold, robed in silk and brocade, and treading, when
she walked from room to room, on cashmere shawls;
elevating her, in fact, into the queen of realms which
had as clear an existence in their imagination as the
kingdoms in the thousand and one Arabian nights.
Whoever has perused thus far this melancholy account<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
will have seen how sad a reality has been substituted
for such pleasing visions. Her memoirs, if ever they
are written, must be found in her letters, of which
many hundreds may yet be in the hands of her various
correspondents: for her pen was very prolific. And,
were it possible to hope that a sufficient number of
these could be obtained from the individuals possessing
them, on the pledge that they should be devoted to
such a purpose, a compilation might be made, not less
entertaining than instructive. Some of her letters on
political subjects would be read with great attention
by the world, both for the style and for the enlarged
and original views they contain. Of these perhaps
the most carefully written, at least since she came
abroad, are those addressed to the late Mr. Coutts,
the eminent banker. The letters she received, I believe,
were very generally burned. I have entered her
room when she had before her a pile of them squeezed
up that would have filled an oven, which she was preparing
to have consigned to the flames. She told me
that, before Miss Williams’s death, a heap twice as
large had been destroyed. This gave me some idea
of the extent of her correspondence.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
The contrast between the way in which she actually
employed her time and the way in which most people
supposed she spent it affords a curious illustration of
the strangely erroneous impressions which sometimes
get abroad concerning remarkable individuals. For
the last six or eight years, with the exception of her
multifarious correspondence and the occasional visit of
a traveller, her hours were filled up in counteracting
the intrigues of her maids, or of the Emir Beshýr, or
of Mahomet Ali—and I never could see that she
attached much more importance to the one than the
other: in doing acts of charity; in stimulating the
Druzes to rise in arms against Ibrahim Pasha; in fostering
the Sultan’s declining power; in bringing consuls
to what she considered their true bearings; and
in regulating her household. Who would suppose,
for instance, that four long hours were spent this day
in sorting napkins, table-cloths, quilts, pillows, &amp;c.,
preparatory to the prince’s visit. Her minute directions
in those matters would have worn out the most
indefatigable housekeeper. Of what assistance I might
be on such occasions I never could make out; but
she generally requested me to be present, if it were
only, she said, to be a voucher for her against the
lies of the women, who often stood her out, when her
orders were not executed, that she had not given
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
During the day she called in a Metouali servant-girl
about thirteen years old, who perhaps had not
been in her presence for a year: but, under the pretence
of examining whether her hair had been kept in
a cleanly condition, she really wanted to ascertain
whether there were any appearances of levity about
her. This led to a conversation concerning little
children. “Were I a despotic sovereign,” observed
she, “I would institute a foundling hospital upon a
different plan to those now in existence, where children
should be received, and placed in the care of the
daughters of people in good circumstances, under the
direction of old women, that these young persons
might learn how to nurse, and dress, and dandle, and
manage infants when they themselves became mothers.
What is so shocking as to find English girls who are
married, and have never seen how an infant is taken
care of?<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> They bring one into the world, and know
no more the duties of a mother—no, not so well as
the sheep and the asses. What is the reason you
always see little lambs and little foals gambolling
about so, and little children always crying? there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
must be something wrong, and that I would
obviate?”</p>

<p>Lady Hester spoke of Mahomet Ali and Boghoz
Bey, his minister, once a penniless Armenian adventurer,
who went to Egypt to seek his fortune. “I
consider Boghoz,” said she, “as one of the most consummate
politicians in Europe. He is not an Armenian,
although he says he is—his mother was; so
was his ostensible father, a rich merchant;—but I
have found out his real father. His real father was a
Turkish aga, named” (I forgot who) “who used to
pay clandestine visits to her, and he is the fruits of
them. When I wrote to him once, I gave him such
a trimming!—something in this way.—‘Sir, I once
knew, when I was in Egypt, a Mr. Boghoz, a polite
and accomplished gentleman, who left very agreeable
recollections of himself in my memory. I hear now
there is a Boghoz Bey, the minister of his Highness
the Viceroy of Egypt, and that he has joined in a
revolution with his master against his legitimate
sovereign. If Boghoz Bey would listen to me, I
would tell him that partial revolutions never succeed,
and that I never thought well of them. The lot of
those who rise against their lawful sovereign has
always been unfortunate. Show me an example of
a usurper, who has not ended badly: even Buonaparte
could not bear to be called one. I a usurper!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
were his words—I found a crown in the mud, and
placed it on my head. When servants take a ride
in their master’s coach, everybody scoffs and laughs
at them, and they are sure to get overturned. The
column of power, which Mahomet Ali has raised,
will melt away, like snow before the sun, as soon as
his good fortune has come to its zenith. I cannot
change my opinion, and Boghoz Bey need not attempt
to make me: for he might as well attempt to
make a quaker uncover himself before a king, which
several monarchs in Europe have not succeeded in
doing.’”</p>

<p>Wednesday, April 4.—To-day, as usual, I did not
see Lady Hester. Her maid told me she had ordered
her window-shutters to be closed, and not to be disturbed
on any account.</p>

<p>April 6.—Lady Hester was better. She informed
me that Ibrahim Pasha’s affairs were growing critical;
for Sherýf Pasha was so badly wounded in the leg
that he could not stir from his bed, and Sulymàn
Pasha was blockaded in the Horàn. These two generals,
she added, had lost full 10,000 men, and the
Arabs and Druzes were grown so bold that they had
penetrated as far as Hasbéyah, and had made considerable
booty.</p>

<p>As the Druze insurrection has excited considerable
attention in Europe, and as the origin of it is but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
imperfectly known, I may be excused for making a
short digression from my diary in order to give the
reader such information respecting it as I picked up
in conversation with individuals, who, from their
proximity to the scene of action, may naturally be
supposed to have drawn it themselves from good
sources.</p>

<p>The prince of the Druzes, known by the title of
the Emir of the Druzes, or the Emir Beshýr (Emir
being his title and Beshýr his prenomen, as we should
say Prince Edward), has, in the course of his long
life—for he is now more than eighty-four years of
age—been obliged to fly from his principality three
or four times, having, on many occasions, with difficulty
escaped the vengeance of three successive pashas
of Acre, who, for his treasonable practices, by mandates
from the sultan, sought his head. Twice or
three times he took refuge in Egypt. His last flight
to that country was not many years ago; where,
until he was able to return to Mount Lebanon again,
he lived, it was said, in obscurity, unnoticed by Mahomet
Ali. He must be a wise man who could say
whom Mahomet Ali noticed or not; for, during this
apparent neglect, it is suspected the plan for the
conquest of Syria was laid between them. On his
return to Syria, the Emir Beshýr was reinstated in
his principality. Some events, not necessary to our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
narrative, retarded for a time the projected invasion;
but, at last, seizing upon a propitious moment, Ibrahim
Pasha marched his father’s forces into Syria,
besieged Acre, the stronghold of the country, took
Damascus, all Cœle-Syria, and the sea-coast, and
then led his troops, elate with victory, into Asia
Minor, where he defeated the sultan’s army, and
would have proceeded on to Constantinople, had not
the intervention of the European powers arrested his
course.</p>

<p>Returning to Syria, he organized his new government,
and silently matured his scheme for bringing
Mount Lebanon into subjection. In order to obtain
popularity for himself, stories were industriously circulated
by his emissaries of the total estrangement of
Sultan Mahmood from every tenet and dogma of
Islamism. He was said to frequent houses of ill repute,
to dress like a Frank, to drink wine with the Greeks
in the taverns at Pera, and to have lost all sense of
Mussulman propriety. These scandalous rumours
were promulgated in all directions with a sinister
view to elevate, by comparison, the character and life
of Ibrahim Pasha; for there is nothing so revolting to
the true believers as any approximation to European
usages and vices: and whatever some writers, in their
ardour for civilization, as they designate it, may
fancy, no amalgamation ever can be formed between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
nations so opposite in climate, habits, religion, and
dress, as the Europeans and Orientals. Be this as it
may, it is not improbable that these malevolent reports,
to a certain extent, answered the ends for which
they were designed, insensibly undermining the
sultan’s personal influence, and disposing the Syrian
mussulmans to regard Ibrahim Pasha as an apostle of
their faith.</p>

<p>It was not until the fourth year from his first invasion
that Ibrahim Pasha attempted the complete
subjugation of Mount Lebanon. The Druzes are a
warlike people, hardy, accustomed to fatigue and to
the use of arms, living in villages difficult, nay, impossible
of access for artillery, and easily capable of
defence from their natural position. All their houses
are of stone, and the interminable succession of field
walls forms favourable breastworks for opposing an
approaching enemy. Some old castles, dating from
the time of the crusaders, are still standing in various
parts of the country, generally on sites commanding
the surrounding neighbourhood. Beside the Druzes,
there is a race of Christians, known as the Maronite
population, whose villages cover that part of the chain
of Mount Lebanon which runs behind Tripoli as far
as Calât el Medýk and the plain of Accár, where a
narrow defile occurs, through which there is a communication
between the plains of Accár and the Bkâa,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
which is the plain that divides Lebanon and Ante-Lebanon.
Beyond this defile, the mountain rises into
a lofty chain, running towards Latakia; and here dwell
the Ansaréas, the Ishmaelites, and some other races:—but
we have only to do now with Mount Lebanon.</p>

<p>By arrangements, supposed to have been previously
made between the Emir and Ibrahim Pasha, and in
order that it might look as if the Emir was taken
totally by surprise, one fine night in the summer,
several regiments of Ibrahim Pasha’s troops were
marched from Acre, Sayda, and Tripoli, on one side,
and from Damascus and Bâalbec on the other, so as
to arrive at <i>Btedýn</i> (the Emir’s palace) at Dayr el
Kamar (the chief town) and at all the other important
points of Mount Lebanon, precisely on the same day,
and as nearly as possible precisely at the same hour.
Either that the time had been well chosen, inasmuch
as the Druzes were then employed in harvesting and
other agricultural labours, or else the plan had been so
laid as to ensure success and to preclude resistance:
the result was that the mountain was taken possession
of without firing a gun. The Emir Beshýr, acknowledged
to be the most consummate and perfidious
hypocrite of modern times, played his part so well and
feigned such great trepidation and alarm when two
regiments marched into the courtyard of his palace,
that he persuaded his household, his minister, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
Druze people in succession, that he was the victim of
the stratagem as much as they were themselves.</p>

<p>But, although Ibrahim Pasha had thus concentrated
in the Lebanon a sufficient force to overawe the Druzes,
the material fact was not to be overlooked that they
were still in possession of their arms, which, under
favourable circumstances, they might turn against
the occupants. His first step, therefore, was to disarm
them, which was done effectually; those who were
refractory being either bastinadoed, or, if they exhibited
any very aggravated resistance, put to death. Many,
however, succeeded in secreting their weapons. Not
to have too much work on his hands at once, Ibrahim
exempted the Christians from the disarmament, and,
by cajoling and pretending he was disposed to favour
them, he flattered the petty vanity, that readily
manifests itself in a population which the superiority
of the Druzes and long habits of servility to mussulman
masters had kept somewhat in a state of inferiority;
for, although the Maronites, who never live
much away from Mount Lebanon, hold themselves not
at all inferior to the Druzes, it is not so with the
Greeks and Greek Catholics of the villages, who,
creeping through life in abject submissiveness to their
rulers, were easily entrapped by so flattering and unexpected
a compliment. The consequence was that,
what with fine silk girdles and turbans of brighter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
colours than before, what with a brace of pistols and
the conceit their new privilege inspired, persons who
had returned to the mountain after the absence of a
year, would not have known them. Thus was created
a certain degree of dislike in the breasts of the Druzes,
who saw the Maronites and other Christians take
the part of their oppressors against them; but, when
a sufficient time had elapsed for leaving this source of
jealousy to ferment between the two parties, Ibrahim
Pasha played off another of those tricks for which he
is unrivalled. Abbas Pasha, his nephew, one day
happened to see one of the principal Christians, a
warden of the Emir Beshýr’s, dressed out very finely,
with his pistols in his girdle, and with side arms;
“Who is that man?” said he, in a loud tone of voice;
“what is all that finery? what is the meaning of those
pistols, of that khanjàr, and that sabre? why, what
am I to wear, if those fellows appear in my presence
such fine gentlemen? Some remedy must be found
for this—I must see to it.” True enough he did;
for, very shortly after, the Christians were desired to
bring their arms and give them up, and the same
measures were resorted to for enforcing the order in
reference to them which had already been applied with
such savage rigour to the Druzes.</p>

<p>The whole of Syria was now defenceless. The
beautiful bazars of Damascus, once famous for their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
finely-tempered blades and weapons of defence, which,
for many centuries, conferred such a remarkable reputation
on the artificers of that city, were now shorn of
their splendour. The Turks, who, in general, have
always been proud of displaying their sabres, guns, and
pistols, on their persons or suspended over their sofas,
were now crestfallen: sadness was depicted in every
countenance, and only wolves, jackals, and partridges
seemed to rejoice in the change that had taken place.</p>

<p>But the spirit of the Druzes was not broken: they
began to suspect that they had been betrayed by the
Emir Beshýr. Circumstances transpired from time to
time which led them to suppose that their independence
had been made a traffic of between him and Mahomet
Ali, and that they had been sold to enrich the coffers
of the one, and enlarge the domains of the other. The
equivocal conduct of the Emir Beshýr, his overacted
apprehension, the treachery discoverable in some of
his measures, finally, his known duplicity, led them to
the conclusion that he had betrayed them. To complete
their disasters, Ibrahim Pasha introduced the
conscription among them, a measure so revolting to
their usages, and so utterly at variance with the
voluntary levies of their forefathers, that the severest
punishment, not even the fear of death, could induce
them to submit patiently to so hateful an infliction.</p>

<p>The Druzes are inhabitants of three provinces of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
Syria, viz., Mount Lebanon, Gebel Aali, near Aleppo,
and the Horàn. The proximity of the Horàn to the
Desert and to the Bedouin Arabs, who acknowledge
the authority of neither pasha nor sultan, obviously
suggested that district—little known, indeed, to European
travellers, but affording many natural means of
defence, and far removed from garrisons and cities—as
a refuge from the conscription. Many recruits, therefore,
fled from their families in Mount Lebanon to the
Horàn, until, from increase of numbers and of sufferings
in a common cause, they mustered in sufficient force
to oppose resistance to the Pasha’s troops. They
were joined by the Bedouin Arabs, who hover round
that quarter, and, in their approaches towards Damascus,
gave considerable apprehension to their Egyptian
masters. Sheryf Pasha marched to quell the insurrection,
and Suliman, Pasha of Sayda, joined him.
We have already seen that Sheryf Pasha was wounded
in a rencontre with them; and, taking up the events
that occurred in the course of the campaign from that
date, I shall insert them in my diary as they come to
my knowledge.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
Lady Hester, who was favourable to the cause of
the Sultan and abhorred the Emir Beshýr, whilst she
admired the military talents and known courage of
Ibrahim Pasha, determined, nevertheless, to stigmatize
him as a rebel, and work his overthrow, if she could:
she, therefore, encouraged in every way the hostile
disposition of the Druzes. From the beginning of
Ibrahim Pasha’s successes in Syria, the protection she
afforded to the refugees and wounded from Acre sufficiently
manifested her tendencies. Mahomet Ali, who
was aware of her political abilities, her unflinching
opposition to him, and her fearless support of the
Sultan, had written, through Boghoz Bey, to deprecate
her interference in the affairs of the province, and to
signify that, if she afforded an asylum and counsel to
his enemies, the tranquillity of Syria could not be
secured. A portion of her answer has already been
given; but when Ibrahim Pasha made so easy a
conquest of the mountain, a word fell from his mouth,
which, if ever the Druzes succeed in expelling him,
may be said to have been the cause of his reverses.
He is reported to have exclaimed from his divan,
when the news of the entire occupation of Mount
Lebanon without firing a single shot was brought to
him, “What, those dogs of Druzes had not a single
bullet for us!” This little sentence was repeated to
Lady Hester, and not long afterwards a Druze of some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
note came to pay her a visit. As he entered the
room, she abruptly addressed him in the same words,
“Dog of a Druze! what, hadn’t you one single bullet
for Ibrahim Pasha?”—and then, with a sort of sarcastic
pity, dilated on Ibrahim Pasha’s exultation over
them. She made it a by-word among her servants;
and not a Druze came near the house but he was
saluted with, “Dog of a Druze! what, had not you a
single bullet for the Pasha?” To people connected
with Ibrahim Pasha’s government, she told the same
story, seemingly as if in praise of the Pasha’s bravery,
who loved war so much that he could not bear an easy
and bloodless conquest, even though to his own advantage.
In every quarter, through every channel,
the Pasha’s saying was echoed in the Druzes’ ears:
and his followers, thinking it an anecdote that told
well for their master, did not consider that it rankled
in the bosoms of the Druzes, who, stung to the core by
these cutting words, swore never to sleep until the
hour of vengeance came.</p>

<p>We will now return to the narrative of the occurrences
which were passing in Lady Hester’s house.</p>

<p>Saturday, April 7.—This day, when I saw Lady
Hester, she asked me if, on entering, I had observed
anybody under the olive-tree outside of the gate: I
answered I had. “Well,” said she, “go and talk to
her.”—“But the person I saw was a poor man,” I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
replied.—“Ah! that’s the one,” resumed Lady Hester;
“that’s not a man, but a woman in man’s
clothes: that woman, at the siege of Acre, used to
carry water to the artillerymen on the ramparts,
during the fire, to drink, and was never in the least
afraid; she is worth seeing: she comes to me every
year for a little money. I used to give her 150 or
200 piasters: but, as I am poor now, take her fifty,
and tell her I am rather short of money.” I went,
and sat down and talked with her. She had a small
gray eye and a placid countenance: she seemed to be
very well aware of the movements of the Pasha’s troops,
and it struck me afterwards that she might be accustomed
to use her disguise for the same purposes in
Lady Hester’s service that the woman spoken of in a
former part did for the first Lord Chatham. I told
her Lady Hester was ill, and that there was no chance
of seeing her: I added some tobacco to the present
which her ladyship had sent her; and, in very proper
terms, she returned thanks, and went away.</p>

<p>Sunday, April 8.—Osman Chaôosh had been sent
to Beyrout for money, and returned to-day, bringing
only £40, the bill on Mr. Michael Tutungi having
been protested. The steamboat from England had
arrived, and there were no letters.</p>

<p>Monday, April 9.—When I first came to Jôon,
Lady Hester Stanhope had expressed an inclination to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
see one of Lady Charlotte Bury’s novels: so, having
at length received, on the preceding evening, the
“Memoirs of a Peeress,” which I had written for to
France, I began reading it to her to-day. She was
calm and composed. The history of events, so well
known to her, seemed to afford her singular pleasure;
and it was evident that if she had always sought for
amusement in books, instead of spending her time in
disciplining incorrigible knaves and wenches, she might
have found many happy hours, even in the midst of
sickness and solitude.</p>

<p>Lady Hester had been looking into the book in the
course of the day. “I do not think,” observed she,
“that the heroine’s character is hers;” (meaning Lady
Charlotte’s,) “it seems to me a fictitious one, made
up partly of her own observations, partly of what has
happened to herself: if it is anybody, it must mean
Lady Caher. Perhaps Lady Charlotte’s husband
writes the books, and she supplies the materials. The
style is not that of a woman like her; she is more
likely to set off on foot three or four miles to see how
they ploughed (at Abra, for example,) like an active
Scotch woman; but, as for writing a book, I think
she was no more likely to do it than I am.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
not write a book, doctor, if you would give me the
world. Ah! I could dictate a little to anybody who
wanted to write down a correct account of circumstances
that I know.</p>

<p>“I remember Lady Charlotte’s first going to court,
and the effect was very much what she describes of
Miss Mordaunt:—that is, somebody said she is too
thin—very handsome, to be sure, but too thin: and
somebody else observed that, in a year’s time, when
she filled out, she would be remarkably beautiful, which
turned out to be the case. She was three years older
than me, but she had such a hand and arm, and such
a leg! she had beautiful hair too, gold colour, and a
finely-shaped nose, and fine complexion. In about
three years she all at once disappeared from the <i lang="fr">beau
monde</i>: she married her cousin, who was poor, and
was still Lady Charlotte Campbell, but always in
uneasy circumstances. When he died, she travelled
into Italy, for the sake of educating her children, and
there she married the tutor:—some of those tutors
are very good-looking men. There was a daughter of
the D*** of B*******, who married a tutor. To be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
sure they were carroty, although she was the prettiest;
but the D*** would not see her for three years, and,
at last, they gave him a living. One of the R******
family also married a tutor.”</p>

<p>I read on, and came to the passage where the
heroine speaks of herself as grown old, and having
lost her charms. Here Lady Hester interrupted
me:—“That cannot be her,” said she; “for C. told
me she is still a loveable woman, and that the Persian
Ambassador left England desperately in love with
her.”</p>

<p>An Englishman, as it was supposed, in the course
of the day, was seen to pass the gate, and was observed
taking sketches towards the south side of the
walls; he spoke to nobody, and went his way: who
or what he was no one knew.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Thursday, April 12.—The whole of the last week
had been a busy one with Lady Hester, who, in spite
of her weakness, had rummaged out all her best sheets,
bought new dinner-napkins, had particular and strange
marks put to them, and, on the certainty of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
prince’s coming, had ordered the road within the gate
up to the strangers’ garden to be new laid and rolled,
the doors to be fresh painted, and such other preparations
to be made as should give an air of cleanliness,
if of nothing else, to her solitary abode.</p>

<p>This day was showery; yet, notwithstanding, about
three o’clock, she issued from her chamber, and, requesting
me to be present, she made the store-room
man produce all the contents of his china-closet and
spread them out on the pavement of the courtyard
before her; where, seated with her stick in her hand
to point and strike with, she examined, re-examined,
and classed everything, until she had made up a
breakfast and dinner service for the prince, as also
one for his Turkish attendants, and one for his European
servants.</p>

<p>It was on such occasions as these that Lady Hester
infused activity into the most sluggish. A blunder,
an act of stupidity, or a lie, was sure to be followed
by a smart blow on the shoulders from her stick,
which fell like a German corporal’s on a soldier at
drill. The epithets of beast, rascal, stupid fellow,
etcetera, were dealt out with much freedom and
readiness in the Arabic language. An old blue and
white teapot, two teacups and saucers, and two plates,
one a little broken, were all she could muster of the
same pattern for tea-things; and, for dinner, white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
plates and dishes composed a plain but decent set.
In my own house, not five hundred yards off, I had a
complete breakfast set in white French porcelain, and
another in English ware, as also a spare dinner service:
these I pressed her to make use of for the
prince, but she would not listen to it:—“let him see
what I am reduced to,” she said. Lastly, she sent
for the two servants who were to wait at table on the
prince, and ordered them to set out on the ground
(for there was no table in her apartments, except the
old card-table, which alternately went from her bed-room
to her saloon, and from her saloon to her bed-room,
as she moved from one to the other) all the
plates and dishes as if for dinner, that they might
take a lesson. But, as it was impossible to make
them understand anything about order or symmetry,
I suggested that one of my lads, who was accustomed
to lay the cloth, should be promoted to that post
during the prince’s stay. “Let me see first if he
knows,” said Lady Hester: so Mahmôod, a Turkish
lad of sixteen, was sent for. He had never seen Lady
Hester, and, like all those who were shut out from
her courtyard and garden, thought her some mysterious
being: judge, therefore, of his fright when he
came before her. Being told what he was called for,
he set about it as he had been taught by Miss Longchamp,
who, in the French fashion, and at a round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
table, had made him place the soup-terrine in the
middle. This excited a loud exclamation from Lady
Hester, and afforded her an opportunity of showing
how a table was laid in fashionable houses. The
scene lasted until sunset, and Mahmôod was duly
promoted to the office of <i lang="fr">buffetier</i> to the prince’s
table!</p>


<div class="footnotes"><p class="center">FOOTNOTES:</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> A collection of the Arabic letters which she had received

<p class="p2">Easter Sunday, April 15.—About five o’clock in
the afternoon the prince’s two European servants rode
into the yard, followed by three or four mule-loads of
baggage. An immense sack, containing bedding, and
two or three trunks were unloaded. A trestle, with a
deal top, was set up immediately as a table in his
room, and his portfolio, ink, &amp;c., were put on it, as if
ready for any memorandums he might wish to note
down, whilst fresh in his memory, showing the foresight
of a traveller who was aware of the impossibility
of finding a thing so necessary as a table in Eastern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
countries, where men make their knees their writing-desk.
Close upon these arrived seven or eight more
mules with his Tartar, the count’s servant, and the
drivers, in all thirteen animals to keep. The rest of
his suite remained in Sayda, Lady Hester having
made a request to him that he would bring none of
Mahomet Ali’s people with him, as she had no accommodation
for them. The fact was, she did not
wish them to come, lest they should get information
from the servants respecting the different proscribed
individuals who had from time to time found an
asylum in her house. In about half an hour the
prince’s arrival was announced, and I received him
and Count Tattenbach at the entrance of the strangers’
garden.</p>

<p>The prince’s costume was picturesque, and, as far
as a European dress will allow, was skilfully arranged
for effect. An immense Leghorn hat, lined under the
brim with green taffetas, shaded his very fair complexion.
An Arab keffiyah was thrown over his
shoulders in the shape of a scarf; and a pair of blue
pantaloons of ample dimensions marked an approach
towards the Turkish <i>sherwàls</i>, those indescribable
brogues, which, from their immense width, take yards
of cloth to make them. His boots were Parisian in
their cut; and it was clear, from the excellent fit, that
he felt his pretensions to a thorough-bred foot were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
now to be decided magisterially. It was singular
enough that every traveller, who came to Dar Jôon
after M. Lamartine’s book had appeared, seemed to
think that Lady Hester Stanhope would necessarily
make comments on his feet, and so tried to screw
them into an arch, under the hollow of which water
might run without wetting the sole. One man, an
Italian, had gone so far as to wear laced half-boots
like women’s <i>brodekins</i>, and stuck them in my face,
whilst we were smoking a pipe together preparatory
to his interview, as much as to say—“Will these
qualify me as high born?” But the prince had no
occasion to use such artifices to set off his person: he
was a fine man, whose exterior denoted high birth,
and could not but leave a favourable impression. The
grand ordeal however was still to go through, and
Lady Hester’s opinion was yet to decide on his
pretensions.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span></p>

<p>As soon as he had rested an hour, she received him
and the count, and at sunset they left her to go to
dinner: for she had long ceased to dine with anybody,
excepting now and then, though rarely, when she admitted
me to that honour. Between dinner and his
return to Lady Hester, the prince told me that, from
the loss of her teeth, Lady Hester’s articulation was
somewhat indistinct, and that moreover she spoke
sometimes in a very low tone of voice. He therefore
wished me to let her fancy he was a little deaf, and
hoped to be permitted to draw his chair close to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
sofa.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> This was settled to his satisfaction, and he
again joined Lady Hester, and remained with her until
an advanced hour in the night.</p>

<p>Monday, April 16.—The prince rose about eleven
o’clock, and at noon I paid my respects to him. I
found him in a dressing-gown with a <i>fez</i> on his head,
tied round with a black bandelet, which set off his complexion.
He dwelt for some time on the extraordinary
powers and animation of Lady Hester Stanhope’s
conversation. I then conducted him to the stables,
and showed him the two mares, which he admired, but
saw at once that the hollow back of one of them was a
natural defect and not a miraculous formation. In the
afternoon, when Lady Hester sent to say she was in
her saloon, and was ready to receive him, he went,
and remained with her until sunset.</p>

<p>After dinner a messenger came from Beyrout with
a letter from Monsieur Guys to acquaint Lady Hester
of the arrival of the steamboat, and that there was no
letter for her. His letter also contained a message from
Dr. Bowring, who was sojourning at Beyrout, signifying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
that he was desirous of paying a visit to her. Lady
Hester dictated an answer immediately to this effect:—“Lady
Hester Stanhope cannot receive any Englishman
holding an official situation, whatever his merit,
&amp;c., may be; because, if <em>she did</em>, it would be a mortal
blow to him under a —— government like the
present. When she has settled all these intriguers,
she will be ready to pay homage to Dr. Bowring’s
talents, if he chooses to come, or to those of others
like him.” Lady Hester desired me to read this letter
over to the prince, before it went. He suggested that
the term “—— government” was too strong. “Lady
Hester,” he remarked, “is a woman privileged to say
anything, we all know—but she might suppress that
word, or change it, and put ‘stupid,’ or ‘short-sighted,’
or ‘so ignoble in its proceedings.’” He observed
too the words, “those of others like him”—as
being a slight on Dr. Bowring. “He is an excellent
man,” added the prince, “and I like him; and moreover
I promised to ask her to receive his visit: he
will take it into his head that I have a hand in the
refusal, thinking that I hate the English, or some
such thing.”</p>

<p>Dr. Bowring was very angry at Lady Hester’s declining
his visit, and she afterwards showed me some
uncourteous verses, which, on quitting Beyrout, he left
to be sent to her. I neglected to take a copy of them;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
but, as far as I recollect, they were to the effect that
“He had found a welcome everywhere except at the
door of a fellow-countrywoman.” If it be true, as was
asserted by a gentleman at Beyrout, that Dr. Bowring
had said in society, that as a member of the British
Parliament, which assembly alone could give away
the public money, he had a right to the hospitality of
a pensioner of government, he grounded his claims on
a very doubtful title. I took good care never to mention
to Lady Hester Stanhope that I had been informed
he had used such expressions: for I do not
believe she would have rested in peace until she had
coupled him with Lord Palmerston in her epistolary war.
Doctor Bowring was not aware that she had thrown
up her pension, and called herself no longer a British
subject; nor did he know perhaps that, in addition to
the prince, he had another advocate for his coming, in
myself. I recollected that I had once been honoured
with his acquaintance, slightly indeed; but I did my
utmost to induce Lady Hester to write a favourable
answer: she however was inexorable. Speaking of
Dr. B., she said, “He is not come here about commerce
and trade, as they pretend, rely upon it: it is
all connected with some intrigue about Sir Sydney
Smith’s wanting to re-establish the Knights of Malta.”</p>

<p>Tuesday, April 17.—Lady Hester began, “What
a handsome man the prince has been, and is still,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
doctor! don’t you think so?” I told her I did, and
that he seemed to me to be what, in romance, would
be called a <i lang="fr">preux chevalier</i>. “And how handy he is,
too,” resumed her ladyship. “Do you know, when I
wanted him to write some memorandums down, he
fetched the pen and ink, opened the card-table, pulled
out the legs, spread the things out before him—a
servant could not do it better. And, only think! he
writes without spectacles, though he is a good deal
older than you are.”—“I supposed him to be about
my age,” said I. “No, he is older,” continued Lady
Hester: “he is a man upon sixty.”</p>

<p>“As to-morrow is Wednesday, when, you know,
I see nobody, you must employ the time in giving
him some advice about different things. He says he
must go away, as he has announced his intention of
being at the Emir Beshýr’s on Thursday; his suite
and luggage are already on the way to Btedýn: and
his Abyssinian—, if she should come here, doctor,
tell Osman that I will not have her stir out of the
strangers’ garden; she must not go peeping here and
peeping there. A slave is a slave: and, whether her
master makes a companion or a scullion-maid of her,
it is of no difference to me: she should remain in her
place; and, whether she belongs to a prince or a shopkeeper,
it is all one, with this difference, that, if the
prince is fond of her, I should wish her to be made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
quite comfortable. If she comes dressed in boy’s
clothes, nobody must take any notice of her:—he is
quite wrapt up in her.</p>

<p>“There are two sorts of Abyssinians,” continued
Lady Hester; “one with Greek features in bronze,
and one of a pug breed. The first have a noble demeanour,
are born to command, and have hands and
feet so beautiful, that nature has nothing superior:
their arms, when they expand them, fly open like
an umbrella: their gestures are clean (<i lang="fr">nets</i>, as the
French say) and perfect. I should not wonder if the
prince contrives to bring her here for me to see her,
and say whether her star is a good one.”</p>

<p>She then reverted to the prince’s person. “Did
you observe his handsome figure?”—(drawing her
hands over her own). “It is astonishing how well
the German tailors, and particularly the Prussian
ones, work: if it is but a cloth of five shillings a yard,
no matter—it’s cut to fit beautifully. The army
tailors in England can’t work a bit. What is a coat,
with the seam of the shoulder coming right across the
joint? how is a man to move his arm, or look well in
it? The French army tailors are bad too: they make
the coats too baboonish; but then they have a tail to
them, a sort of something; it is at least the monkey
who has seen the world: but with the English it is
nothing at all. Then what a beautiful skin the prince<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
has got! Do tell me what Miss L. said: do show
me some of her splaws. You know the French must
be coquettes, from the first lady among them down to
the <i lang="fr">femme de chambre</i>: now, do show me how she sat
and talked. Now, there, doctor, go! for I must see
him; and, if he does not leave us to-morrow, we
shall have time to talk over what you have to say to
him.”</p>

<p>I informed the prince Lady Hester was ready to
receive him, and he went to her. He remained from
two o’clock until half-past six, writing, as she told me
afterwards, from her dictation, several things that she
wished to be known, in order that he might not forget
them. In her usual manner, when he had left her,
and had nearly reached his own room, she sent a servant
to recall him, as having forgotten something. No
one ever got clear off from her at the first <i lang="fr">congé</i>.</p>

<p>The correspondence about her pension occupied
much of Lady Hester’s thoughts. She had requested
me to make a copy of the whole, and to give it to the
prince; this employed me almost all night. When
showing her the copies, she said, “Is there any stability
in anything, if king’s deeds are to be reversed
in this way? In Turkey, a Sultan’s firmans are respected,
even down to a grant of five piasters, though
they may kill him afterwards on his throne; but
nothing in England is safe. If they take away my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
pension, they’ll take Blenheim next, ay, and Strathfieldsaye
too: I should like to write to the Duke of
Wellington and tell him so.”</p>

<p>The prince pronounced himself rather indisposed,
and thus had a sufficient pretext for remaining over
Wednesday. He little knew the consequence of being
unwell when under her ladyship’s roof; her sovereign
remedy, a black dose, was immediately prepared for
him, which he was to take next morning. But, it
having been decided that he should remain, the
<ins title="podarkês">ποδάρκης</ins> Ali was despatched over-night to the Emir
Beshýr, with a verbal message to put off the prince’s
going until Friday. Here, as upon all occasions,
Lady Hester must give her instructions. It was six
in the evening, and Ali had five hours’ quick walking
to perform by moonlight over mountains that would
frighten a European to look at; but he was to set off
instantly, and to endeavour to arrive before the prince
was gone to bed. He was to see the Emir, and to
say, “Such are mylady’s words.” Ali started, and
was back by ten next morning.</p>

<p>Wednesday, April 18.—“The Emir,” said Ali, in
giving an account of his commission, “had retired to
his harým when I got there, so that he could not be
disturbed; but this morning, with the morning star,
he was up, and I was called in. I had not seen him
for three or four years: his beard is as white as snow.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
Approaching, I raised both my hands to my mouth
and forehead, went close to him, and kissed the hem
of his garment. ‘What are you come for, my son?’
said he; ‘I hope her Felicity, my lady, is well.’—‘She
salutes your Felicity,’ said I, ‘and has sent me,
her slave and yours, to say that the German prince,
her guest, being unwell, is obliged to defer the honour
of paying his respects until Friday.’—‘The prince’s
pleasure is mine,’ replied the Emir; ‘and, whenever
he comes, this palace is his, and I shall be proud of
his visit:’ and then,” said Ali, “I came back.” But
Ali had likewise another commission, which he executed
equally well. Wherever he found the prince’s
suite, either on the road or at the Emir Beshýr’s, he
was to order the two Abyssinians to be conducted
back to their master, as he was unwilling they should
remain alone for two or three days among strangers:
this was done.</p>

<p>At half-past one, the slaves arrived. One was a
black girl about twelve years old, and she was dressed
in boy’s clothes; the other, the Abyssinian, a young
woman, was veiled from head to foot in the Egyptian
manner. The Turkish servants seemed to consider
female slaves as a necessary part of a great man’s retinue:
they spoke of it as a matter of course. “His
wife is come,” cried one: “a chair is wanted for the
prince’s shariáh” (concubine), said another: for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
term shariáh is not used in a disrespectful sense in the
East. There was as much bustle about her as if she
had been a European princess, because thus is it done
to those whom their masters choose to honour. “Will
my lady take it ill, that I have brought her here?”
the prince asked me. I told him no; for so, anticipating
the question, she had desired me to say;
adding, “there is not a great man in these countries
who does not travel with his harým in his train, when
his means will allow of it; and in the eyes of the
Mussulmans he is not compromised by having his
slaves here, nor am I in receiving them.”</p>

<p>The prince confined himself to his chamber somewhat
late. I seized the opportunity of enjoying the pleasing
society of Count Tattenbach, whose amiable manners
increased the pleasure which the presence of the prince
had spread over the solitude of Jôon: when the latter
joined us in the saloon, I paid my respects to him.
At Lady Hester’s desire, I requested from him some
information respecting the polytheistic school, which,
from a biographical notice of Heyne, inserted in the
Révue de Paris, she had learned existed in Germany.
The prince told me Heyne was the chief of that sect,
and that its tenets were of a rather general and vague
nature, implying the probability of the existence of
many intermediate links in the chain of beings between
God and man, and of many subordinate deities.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
“I myself,” he added, “if I am not one of them, am
disposed to think that around us invisible spirits may
be hovering higher in degree of creation than ourselves.
When I reflect on man’s capacities and reasoning
powers—just enough, as they are, to make him
sensible how little he is—I sometimes am inclined to
think that perhaps this is hell we live in.”</p>

<p>It appeared that M. Lamartine and his work on
the East had been a subject of conversation between
him and Lady Hester, and he told me the comments
she had made on some passages: “I shall certainly,”
said he, “put them into my journal. However,”
he added, “I ought to observe, and I hope you will
tell my lady so, that, as it will be impossible to have
visited her without writing something about her, I
shall say nothing that I have not first submitted to
her inspection.”</p>

<p>He spoke in very ill humour about his dose of salts,
which, as he thought, had done him no good; but he
was much mistaken if he supposed that any objections
he could have raised to being dosed, short of making
his escape, would have saved him.</p>

<p>The correspondence with Lord Palmerston became
a subject of conversation. “Why should my lady
throw up her pension?” said he; “it is perfectly
ridiculous to suppose that M. Guys or any other
consul cares about Colonel Campbell’s silly threats:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
as if he were to dictate to them, and prevent them
from setting their signature to a life certificate, or any
other document. He might say—‘That certificate
will not be held good in England, when presented;’
but beyond that, it was a piece of presumption, which
M. G. very justly called the act of a <i lang="fr">malotru</i>. A
pension is no bad thing. I once neglected an opportunity
of having a good sinecure: for we have them
in Prussia as well as in England. Prince Hardenberg,
who was my father-in-law, and whose favourite
I was, offered me a place, with nothing to do, and
great pay. I refused it out of delicacy, but I have
since repented of it; for, so long as they are to be
given away, it is as well for one to take them as
another.” I do not know whether the prince’s casuistry
is conclusive, but I know it is entertained by
many persons, although it did not accord with Lady
Hester’s notions. After dinner, the prince went to
her Ladyship, and remained till a late hour.</p>

<p>Thursday, April 19.—There came to-day a Mograbyn,
or Barbary shaykh, a resident of Zyb, near Acre,
a place where many shaykhs live, men versed in the
Mahometan tenets and traditions, and reputed of
great piety. He introduced himself to me as a person
in the habit of receiving gifts in money from her
ladyship, and of having conversations with her. I
gave him to understand that the moment was not a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
propitious one, and thought I had got rid of him, as
he mounted his mare and rode away.</p>

<p>The prince sent Count Tattenbach to ask me to
come and sit with him in the evening. His Abyssinian
slave was at one end of the divan and he at the
other. She appeared to be about seventeen, had
regular features, and, as well as I could see by candlelight,
where bronze features are rather indistinct, was,
on the whole, a handsome girl. She was called <i>Mahbôoby</i>
(<i lang="fr">Aimée</i>). “Poor thing!” thought I, “the
position to which you are raised would be envied by
many a European fine woman, and to you it brings
nothing but <i lang="fr">ennui</i>. Your lord may adore you—perhaps
does; but he cannot say five words to you in
any language that you understand, although he speaks
several with great purity; and every action of his life
is contrary to the usages in which you have been
brought up. Happier far would have been your lot,
had your purchaser been some Turkish aga, or some
shopkeeper, who, in making you mistress of a small
household, would have found you employment conformable
to your habits, and have left you to the
natural and domestic occupations to which you have
been accustomed: he would have placed you where
your position, lawful in the eyes of your neighbours,
would have been an honour to you, instead of its
being, where you will go, a matter of scandal and reproach.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
Time, however, may bring you acquainted
with some language in which you and your master
may exchange ideas, education may ripen them, and
then, perhaps, you will have acquired tastes congenial
to his, and the tie that unites you may be strengthened
by something more lasting than at present.”</p>

<p>Whilst the conversation was going on, Mahbôoby
fell asleep, and forgot for a time her greatness and her
troubles. The little negress, about twelve years old,
dressed as a boy, sat in a corner of the room, and was
remarkable for her air, at once sprightly without
being vulgar. The prince was summoned to go to
Lady Hester. Our rising awoke the Abyssinian girl,
and hardly were we out of the room when I heard
their two tongues running glibly, as if relieved from
the constraint which his presence and mine had put
on them.</p>

<p>In the course of the day, he had taken the Abyssinian
into Lady Hester’s garden to walk. I was
in the saloon at the time with her ladyship, the
windows of which looked into the garden. Zezefôon,
who knew what a sacred place the garden was held,
and who was jealous that a slave like herself should be
acting the mistress where she was a menial, came
in a hurry to say that the prince and Mahbôoby were
in the garden. Lady Hester grew fidgety immediately
at this intrusion on her privacy, so little in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
accordance with her exclusive principles. “I can’t
bear,” said she, “that anybody should be hanging
about me in that manner; perhaps he may come in
here as he goes past the door. It will not do; I
must have my place to myself, if it is no bigger
than a barn, and no better—no matter, so as nobody
comes there but when I send for him: tell him,
doctor, that I can’t bear it.” I observed that, to a
man of his rank, it would seem rude for such a prohibition
to come from me. “Well,” said she, “I will
tell him myself; but there is one thing I wish you to
say to him for me, for that I can’t say myself. You
know he will be writing all about me; and, although
I do not care what he says of my temper, understanding,
doings, and all that, I shouldn’t like him to say
anything about my person, either as to my looks,
figure, face, or appearance: it will be better for him
merely to write that he had nothing to observe about
my personal appearance, as there were few people in
society but might recollect what I was, and to dwell
on the looks of a sick woman could have nothing very
pleasing in it.”</p>

<p>In the mean time, Lady Hester saw the prince
twice a day, once before dinner, and afterward in the
evening, when he generally remained until a late
hour. I could observe she already began to obtain an
ascendency over him, such as she never failed to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
over those who came within the sphere of her attraction:
for he was less lofty in his manner than he had
been at first, and she seemed to have gained a step in
height, and to be disposed to play the queen more
than ever.</p>

<p>Woe to him who dared to show pretensions equal
to hers! she would drive him from stronghold to
stronghold, until he must capitulate upon any terms.
The count at first had accompanied the prince in his
interviews, but she gradually contrived to get rid of
him in a certain degree, under the plea that his ill
health and his wound would not be benefitted by sitting
up: as she made it a rule, if possible, never to
see more than one person at a time. She would say,
“Do you suppose people will talk with freedom when
any one is by?—and, besides, it distracts attention,
first turning to one and then to another.”</p>

<p>An incident of some interest occurred about this
time: Mahbôoby was conducted to Lady Hester by
the prince to have her star read, and this is what her
ladyship said to me afterwards on that subject: “I
told you, doctor, there were two sorts of Abyssinians,
one with Greek features, the other of the pug breed:
Mahbôoby is not of the first class, but of the last.
She will be good-tempered, faithful, and obedient:
should the prince be ill, I’ll venture to say she will
sit by him to guard him, and watch over him without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
sleeping for months together: but she will never do
for a housekeeper, never for a mistress; she will learn
nothing. Her awkward gait, her roll in the fashion of
the felláhs, and all that, are habits she will not easily
get rid of. What the prince should have done was to
have placed her for a year or two in a family at Cairo,
where French was spoken, or Italian, and there, with
another to wait on her, when she had acquired the
language, he should have taken her to himself, and
have sold or given away the other; but I question
whether servants in Germany will wait on her. He
bought her from a Frenchman, who had purchased
some slaves on speculation to sell them. There were
two others; but he saw they were devils; and, not
wishing to have the trouble of putting up with a bad
temper, or of putting it down, he took the one he
thought good-natured. She is horribly dressed, but
she is well made. It is a thing that will not last.”</p>

<p>During the morning, Count Tattenbach gave me
the relation of a long illness which he had undergone
in the neighbourhood of that unhealthy spot, Sparta:
it was a malignant fever. Such fevers are the curse of
those otherwise happy climates: for let not the native
of a cold country, like England, when he reads the
flowery description of blue skies and blue seas, of
lands where eternal summer reigns, where the orange
and the olive grow, fancy that Nature has forgotten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
her general rule of equalizing her gifts. The favours
she would at first sight seem to have bestowed on one
region of the earth in preference to another have
generally some counterpart in scourges and visitations,
from which climates apparently less blessed are exempted.
Count Tattenbach was confined six months
to his bed with fever and dysentery.</p>

<p>I mentioned this to Lady Hester, and, in conformity
with her system, that every person’s star, whilst descending
to its nadir, even although otherwise a
favourable one, may have sinister influences, which
change to brighter prospects as the star again mounts
to its zenith, she told me to comfort him by the assurance
that he had seen the most unfortunate years of
his life, and might now hope for better ones. “Tell
him the story,” continued she, “of Abdallah, the
black slave” (and this was a very favourite story of
hers), “who was sultan for a day: you have heard of
it twenty times, and I dare say you don’t recollect it.”
I confessed I did not. “Well, then,” resumed she,
“there was a black who had been bought by a cruel
master, who treated him with constant harshness: he
put him to the most severe tasks, and, not contented
with the customary service of a slave, he made a beast
of burden of him, by putting a pack-saddle on his back,
and loading him like an ass. The poor Abdallah bore
all his hardships without repining; when one day,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
whilst he was in the fields, carrying manure with his
panniers on his back, the <i>tyr el hakem</i> hovered over his
head, and was seen by the inhabitants of the place.
The tyr el hakem is a bird known in the East; and
the people have a rooted belief that the individual, over
whose head it hovers, is, or will come to be a sovereign.
The reigning sultan died just at the time, and, the report
having spread of the omen manifested in favour
of Abdallah, nothing would content the populace, but
that Abdallah should be proclaimed his successor: but
Abdallah was a poor, uneducated creature, and, sensible
of his incapacity for so elevated a station, he prayed to
God that, if he were to be sultan, his reign might expire
shortly. God granted his prayer; for he died the
same day that he was proclaimed; and, to this hour, the
curious and pious Mussulmans who visit Constantinople
go to see the tomb of Sultan Abdallah, the negro.
Thus,” continued Lady Hester, “those who are
depressed by wretchedness and misfortune, may, in
an hour, if such is the will of God, be elevated to the
pinnacle of greatness.”</p>

<p>As I did not very clearly perceive what analogy
there was between Count Tattenbach’s typhus fever
and the black’s sufferings, although I complied with
Lady Hester’s wish in relating the story, I generalized
it, and left out the particulars of the pack-saddle. The
count was grateful to her for the interest she took in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
his past sufferings; and, to prove it to her, as she considered
him hardly convalescent, he politely consented
to take another black dose.</p>

<p>About four o’clock in the afternoon, I accompanied
the prince and the count for a ride, and took them to
a spot where, from a lofty peak, they looked down on
a secluded valley, singularly striking, from the wild,
mountainous scenery in which it is embosomed. In the
bottom of the ravine stands a monastery of schismatic
Catholics, called <i>Dayr Sëydy</i>. The prince proved
himself a bold rider, as he often kept his horse in a
trot over places where a person, used only to European
roads, would have thought his neck in danger at a
foot-pace. In our way I showed him <i>Dayr el Benát</i>,
a convent; a fine old <i>ilex</i>, or evergreen oak, whose
main branches stretch out horizontally about forty feet
from the trunk, and whose trunk measures seven
French metres in circumference; also a willow, with
beautiful bloom, like orange flowers (<i lang="fr">saule du Levant
aux fleurs odoriférantes</i>). We returned just after
sunset with a good appetite, I having slipped over my
horse’s head, saddle and all, in one of the steep descents,
where the prince trotted on like a fearless horseman, as
he is. After dining with my family, I joined him
again. He was dictating his journal to the young
count: Mahbôoby was lying on an ottoman in the
corner of the room covered over with a quilt, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
black girl with her, one with her head peeping out at
one extremity, and one at the other, a favourite mode
of sleeping two in a bed in the Levant. What advantage
it has over the European manner I never could
discover. Lying at full length, and sleeping at all
hours, whether by day or by night, are the great
enjoyments of the blacks, as has been already observed.
Travellers in these countries, however exalted their
rank, are compelled, under many circumstances, to
overlook such apparent violations of decorum, and
descend from their stilted forms of good breeding to
those homely approaches to a state of nature.</p>

<p>Saturday, April 21.—After a long conversation the
preceding night with Lady Hester, the prince to-day
prepared for his departure. I did not see him until
noon, being engaged with Lady Hester for two or
three hours, in hearing numberless fresh things which
she had not had time to tell him, and which it now
devolved on me to communicate: but when I joined
him, he was ready to mount, and I was obliged to
leave my commission unexecuted, as had happened
before in the case of Mr. Forster.</p>

<p>“Tell the prince,” said she, “that he must not
dawdle away his time on the road, because, on the
10th of next month (Mahometan), the caravan of the
Hadj (or the Mecca pilgrims) will arrive at <a id="chg2"></a>Damascus,
and it is necessary he should be there to have the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
choice of all the precious things that the pilgrims
bring. The caravan is no great things this year, but
he will be able to find some good otto of roses, and
some sandal-wood oil, which makes a charming perfume.
Then there is a dry leaf, that is a delightful
scent to shut up in bags, or put into a drawer. I
don’t know how it is, doctor, but I never liked French
perfumes—they always made my head ache; but these
Eastern ones are so delightful.”</p>

<p>She went on: “Let the prince know all about
buying horses at Damascus. The horse-dealers there
are the most consummate jockeys I have seen in any
country: they will fatten and make up a horse, that
the devil himself would not know him again. I remember
a horse—a beautiful looking one—was brought
to me, and the man made a great fuss, saying he had
refused I don’t know how many purses for it, but that,
if I fancied the animal, I should have it a bargain. I
answered, ‘that I would not take it even for a gift.’
To look at him he was a superb creature; but I saw
he was made up, and true enough; for he was purchased
at a high price for the Pasha, and, on his road
to Acre, died. There is Mustafa Bey, whose father
was a pasha: well, since he has been out of favour
with the government, even he has carried on this
trade. He has his emissaries, who find out every
young horse good for anything, or any other that can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
be made something of; and, when he has fattened
them up a little, and changed the old ones so as not
to be recognized, he brings them to market. As for
the Emir Beshýr and his head-groom, tell the prince
to have nothing to do with them. The Emir will
give him a horse perhaps worth two or three purses,
and the groom will swear it cost his master fifteen:
so he had better accept none.</p>

<p>“There,” she continued, “I believe that’s all: but
only think what it is to be a well-bred man. I merely
told the prince that I thought he should not let his
slave dine with him, and, lo! he writes me a note
to say she had dined with him for the last time.
And, doctor, I did not do this from ill nature, or from
any other motive than because I think everybody
should be kept in his place. The other little girl,
poor thing, has been sadly used. The prince told me
that, young as she is, she had not escaped the consequences
of that miserable destiny to which slavery
has exposed her.”</p>

<p>I now went to the prince, and, after a short conversation,
about three in the afternoon, when the sun’s
rays were losing their power, he departed. The
prince had made a present of the little black slave
to Lady Hester, but, with the mystery she liked to
throw over everything, this was to be a secret in the
house. Accordingly, Osman Chaôosh mounted an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
ass, apparently to accompany the prince’s suite for a
short distance; but his orders were that, being out of
sight of the house, he should turn off into the Sayda
road, and, taking the little black with him, should
conduct her to town, and leave her at Logmagi’s,
where she was to be trained by Logmagi’s wives for
her ladyship’s service. Thus separated from an indulgent
mistress and friend, where she had nothing to
do, she was made over to people who would probably
treat her in a very different spirit.</p>

<p>The prince left 500 piasters to be divided amongst
the servants. This was a degree of liberality that
was quite at variance with the reports which had preceded
his arrival: for it was currently related of him,
that his parsimony discredited his rank. Lady Hester
immediately ordered the money to be brought to her,
and took the opportunity of distributing it in such a
manner as to reward the diligent and punish the idle,
making the privation to be felt most by those who,
habitually indolent, would only run about when their
mercenary spirit made them anticipate a present.
It may appear strange to the English that her ladyship
should take upon herself the regulation of servants’
vails: but the great Turks always do so, and
no doubt she thought the custom worthy of imitation.</p>

<p>When the cavalcade was gone, I retired to my
house, and, after dinner, went to Lady Hester. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
appeared greatly pleased that her guest had staid so
long, as she knew it would mortify the Emir Beshýr,
to whom the prince had sent three successive messengers,
each time to put off his visit twenty-four hours
longer; whilst it would have a good effect in the eyes
of the people, who saw that he contrived expedients to
stay on at her ladyship’s, although from day to day
he made preparations for going. “He must go to-morrow,”
Lady Hester would say to me; “he kills
me by these long conversations, and he is so tiresome,
asking for this explanation and that explanation. I
said to him last night, when he could not comprehend
something, ‘<i lang="fr">Est ce que votre esprit est dans les ténèbres?</i>’
This is the way I talk to princes—but to you,
forsooth, I must not say so: I must not call you a
fool when you are one, but you must go and sulk, and
turn crusty; but I will though;—neither you, nor
the greatest king on earth, shall make me alter
my ways a tittle. Why, how did I talk to Lord
M******* about G***, when he broke his word about
giving him a ship? I remember, we had dined at the
Admiralty: I had been sitting in the drawing-room
with Lady M******* <i lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>—a tolerable bore, by
the way—and they all came in from the dining-room.
All the mylords were standing about, sipping their
coffee, when Lord M. said to me in his broad Scotch—‘So,
I understond, Lady Hostor, you are vorry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
ongry with me aboot Coptain G——;’ upon which I
gave him such a dressing—and all unprepared—for I
was not thinking about it the least in the world.
There I was in the middle of the room—for I stood
up—like my grandfather, and out it all came. That
was a separate affair from the Scotch job, when Mr.
Pitt said that, during the twenty-five years he had
known Lord M., he never saw him get such a trimming.</p>

<p>“People don’t like to take advice, or to be told of
their faults; but if any one has a piece of bad money,
you tell him of it, and he changes it away or gets rid
of it: for, if he keeps it, he is no richer for it, and, if
already a poor man, he may think he is worth more
than he really is, and you do him a charity to tell
him that what he has got is good for nothing: he may
treasure it up, but it will never be worth a farthing.</p>

<p>“Had you followed my advice six years ago, when
you came to this country, I fancy you would have had
a very different reputation here. If you think that
I am always trying to mortify people, when I am
saying things for their good, you are much mistaken.
If I wanted to humble any one, should I go as high
as the window-seat to pull him down? no, it would be
something higher than that. As I told the Emir
Beshýr, ‘You may rest perfectly quiet; I shall not
trouble myself about you; but, if I did, I would pull<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
you and your mountain down together.’ I must do
everything <i lang="fr">en grand</i>, as Dr. Canova said of me. He
was the Pasha’s doctor, and he remarked to somebody,
in speaking of me—‘I must see her, because,
whether for good or bad, she is a person who does
everything <i lang="fr">en grand</i>: there is nothing little about
her.’</p>

<p>“There is perhaps no one in the world who has
ever done justice to everything in the creation, man
or brute—even down to an ant—like me; even to
the spirits that haunt the air: and I have gone out
of my way to serve you and a thousand others, because
I must be just to everybody. If I abuse people,
I can also bear testimony to their good qualities. My
observations are dictated by truth, and even in persons
I dislike, I can equally see their merits; but, because
they have merits, it does not follow that I must like
them. People are not obliged to make a nosegay of
a medicinal herb, however valuable its properties may
be. But I must give the devil his due, even to his
beauty and his talents, though he has all the vices
attributed to him, and if I turn devil, my vices will be
better than the virtues of most people—for I do not
say of all. If it were not so, should I have resisted,
as I did, all the flattery that was heaped upon me in
Mr. Pitt’s time? but it never turned my head for a
moment: I was as cool as I am now. Nobody could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
ever come over me; and, knowing that, I will not
pass for being capable of meanness and vulgarity,
which only those ever attributed to me who are mean
and vulgar themselves. If there is any one who
thinks he is better than I am, or knows more than I
do, let him come forward, and, if he can show that I
am in the wrong, then I will knock under, but not till
then. God has given me my estate in my head—that
nobody can take from me: and do you think that I,
with my high rank and talents, could be accountable
for my actions, opinions, or expressions, to any human
being, any more than the sun could have its brightness
interfered with by a common star? What I am, you,
if you live long enough, will see: and then you, and a
thousand others, may think yourselves happy to kiss
the dust under my slippers; so pray put all those
ideas out of your head, that I can be unjust to any
one.”</p>

<p>After a pause, she resumed:—“I must have something
extraordinary about me, for Mr. Pitt listened to
me, the Turks listen to me, the Arabs listen to me,
and wherever I go I have a talisman, which makes it
so, and so it must be. When I was young, people
might say there was something brilliant about me,
which caught everybody’s attention. Now, my looks
are gone; but if I had not a tooth in my head, which
will very soon be the case, I shall go on in my old way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
and change for nobody; so do not think with your
grumpiness that I shall alter: and now go to bed. I
am very much obliged to you for writing copies of all
those long letters for the prince; but some day I hope
I shall have it in my power to thank you: so, good
night.” I rose to go, and she went on—“And will
you be so good as to give that blackguard, Mohammed,
a good scolding about my pipes?—Oh! and send for
the secretary to come up the day after to-morrow. I
got rid of him whilst the prince was here: I did not
choose to have him spying about, to carry all his
spyifications to his father, for him to send them to
Beyrout:—and the day after to-morrow I shall look
over Fatôom’s store-room, to see if there are any good
blue plates for visitors;—and mind you have the
banana <i lang="fr">beignets</i> made in the way I told you, for
Mrs. M. to taste:—isn’t it extraordinary that I
should know so much about cooking? I, who got a
slap in the face if ever I went into the kitchen or
spoke to a servant. I was not bred up to the plough;
I was not bred up a carpenter, nor a mason, nor a
blacksmith, nor a gardener; and yet I know all these
trades: isn’t it very extraordinary? And, doctor, ask
John if he will paint that border for me—there’s the
pattern on the book-cover: and let me know if my
two mares have got any more green barley to eat.
Poor things!—every year but this they have always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
had enough to last till the end of May: I don’t know
what they will do. Oh! Fatôom was so delighted
with her forty piasters! Did you rate that other beast
as I told you? I have brought her down prettily to-day:
I told her, if she was taken to market, she would
not fetch so much as a skin<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> of good oil: it mortified
her famously. And, doctor, I must cut out
some linen for the little new black; for there is nobody
can do it but myself. So, good night: only,
when you go out, do just send for the store-room man,
and ask if the wheat, that was put in the sun, is dry
enough to go to the mill.—What a pack of ignorant
people they are in Europe: they don’t know, I verily
believe, what the bread they eat comes from.—Only
look at my pocket-handkerchiefs;—not one that is not
full of holes.—Stop, how is the money? God knows
what we shall do: but never mind—when I get my
£25,000 a-year, I’ll humble those consuls till they
kiss my babôoches.”</p>

<p>Thus would she go on, on a score of different subjects,
of which her head was always full, talking until
two or three in the morning; and always talking most,
just after the person who was with her had risen to go
away. Her greatest delight was to sit and harangue
when her hearers stood around her: it fostered the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
dreams of greatness which floated in her brain; and,
when she saw the homage the natives paid her, and
looked on their oriental humility, she fancied herself,
for a moment, the Queen of the East.</p>


<div class="footnotes"><p class="center">FOOTNOTES:</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="label">[13]</a> Lady Hester’s doctrines went farther than the shape of the
foot; they went even to the tread. “Did I never tell you the
story,” said she one day, “of Lord B.’s friend? He was sleeping
at some inn, I don’t know where, when, in the morning, as he
was lying thinking in bed, he heard a step over his head: he
immediately rang the bell in a state of agitation, and begged to
see the landlord directly. ‘Sir,’ cried he to him, ‘you must tell
me who the person is that slept over my head. I know it is a
woman, and the one too I have been looking for all my life;
her footstep has that in it which will fulfil my warmest hope:
if she is single, I must marry her, or else it will be the death
of me.’ He did marry her, and they were the happiest
couple imaginable: he found in her all that his most sanguine
expectations had fancied, and she made him a most excellent
wife.”</p>

<p class="footnote">Lady Hester delighted in anecdotes that went to show how
much and how justly we may be biassed in our opinions by the
shape of any particular part of a person’s body, independent of
the face. She used to tell a story of ——, who fell in love
with a lady on a glimpse of those charms which gave such
renown to the Cnidian Venus. This lady—luckily or unluckily—happened
to tumble from her horse, and by that
singular incident fixed the gazer’s affection irrevocably. Another
gentleman, whom she knew, saw a lady at Rome get out of
her carriage, her head being covered by an umbrella, which
the servant held over her on account of the rain, and, seeing
nothing but her foot and leg, swore he would marry her—which
he did.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="label">[14]</a> It must be recollected that Lady Hester’s guests were
always placed on a sofa opposite to her.—(See frontispiece.)
On some occasions, she had singular ways of talking, sometimes
as if she was addressing herself to the wall, sometimes to her
lap; and, latterly, when most of her teeth were gone, she
mumbled a little. The prince at another time regretted that
he lost more than half she said.</p>

<p class="p2">Monday, April 23.—During the stay of the prince,
the count lent me a work written by the former,
under the assumed name of Semilasso, and I read a
page or two of it to Lady Hester Stanhope. “Ah!”
cried she, “I see; he writes as he talks: he is not
profound.”</p>

<p>Lady Hester was decidedly better in health, in many
respects; but, notwithstanding, she grew thinner, if
that were possible, and wasted away: she had become
too a little humpbacked. Nevertheless, she now rose
every day, sat up for six or eight hours, walked a little
in her garden, and was almost as active in correspondence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
and in the business of the house as when she
was in perfect health. But the spasmodic jerks in her
lower extremities occasionally returned: her eyes were
more sunk in her head, and her nails continued to
crack; still, as far as I could prognosticate, she was
saved for this year; what another might do was in
the hands of God. The powerful reaction, which her
naturally strong constitution supplied against pulmonary
disease, lay in the unceasing exercise she gave to
her lungs in talking. The ancient physicians held
that speaking and reading aloud were succedanea for
the cessation of bodily exercise in old age. Experience
proves that orators in the senate, barristers (who
have briefs, that is), infirm old women given to garrulity,
scolds, showmen, and all those whose tongues
are constantly going, reach to an advanced period of
life, without motion or fresh air enough, as one would
suppose, to keep the functions of life in activity.</p>

<p>I have known her lie for two hours at a time, with
a pipe in her mouth, when she was in a lecturing
humour, and go on in one unbroken discourse, like a
parson in his pulpit, happy in some flights of eloquence,
which every now and then she was so remarkable
for. Reflection succeeded reflection, anecdote
followed anecdote, so fast, that one drove the other
out of my head, and left me in despair at the impossibility
of committing them to paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
One of her favourite topics was the golden days of
her time, when people of inferior station knew how to
behave themselves; when young men were so well
bred that they never stuck their legs in your face,
never leaned their elbows on the table, never scratched
their noses nor twisted their mustachios, never rubbed
their eyes, never flapped their boots with their whips
and canes, never did this and never did that, until at
last one grew afraid to stir a limb before her, for fear
of committing one of these numberless offences. And,
as her temper was generally soured and her constitution
much weakened, a person felt unwilling to move
her susceptibility, however irksome this enforced stillness
might be to him.</p>

<p>The best proof of good sense with her was to listen
attentively to what she said, and the long experience
of years had convinced me that she was justified, like
Pythagoras, from the superiority of her reasoning
powers, in demanding such acquiescence.</p>

<p>Tuesday, April 24.—It wanted about half an hour
of sunset when I left her: it was Tuesday evening.
Just before going, she said, with a serious air, “Doctor,
take a bit of paper, and write—To-morrow, the
4th Adàr, the 13th Suffar, and the 25th of April<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>—nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
whatever is to be done for me either by you
or by anybody in the house, and the servants are to
do no work. And, doctor, I would advise you to have
nothing done by your family on that day: it is a
nasty month, Suffar: I hate it.” I made no remark
on this strange superstition, which Lady Hester
Stanhope had in common with Julius Cæsar and
others who have passed for great men.</p>

<p>Whilst walking with my family on the Sayda road,
I saw a man coming towards us, mounted on a beautiful
gray mare, with her tail reaching to the ground
(the lower part of it dyed red with henna), and preceded
by a walking groom. “Here comes Sulyman
Hamâady,” said I. “And who is Sulyman Hamâady,”
one of the party replied; “what’s he to us?” As
soon as he had passed, I told them who he was.
Sulyman Hamâady is, at this day, to the Emir Beshýr,
what Tristram the Hermit was to Louis XI. of
France. It is Hamâady who is the hangman of Mount
Lebanon, and the executioner of the many cruelties
that the Emir exercises against his devoted victims,
and, like Tristram, he is the personal friend of that
prince: he is well received by the great, feared by
all classes, and a man of much importance. Honour,
not disgrace, is attached to his office in this country.
A proof of it was that, as we returned home through
the village, we saw Hamâady sitting at the window<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
of the best house in the place, where he was lodged
for the night.</p>

<p>Never was there a man more dreaded than Hamâady.
He was rather thin, but apparently all nerve, grave
in his deportment, with a large, full, but rolling black
eye, and, on common occasions, without any sinister
or harsh expression. Wherever he went, honours
were paid him: he was often received by Lady Hester
Stanhope, and I have drunk a glass of champagne
with him in her company, which he professed not to
like, preferring brandy to it. He was known to enjoy
much of the familiarity, and some portion of the confidence,
of the Emir himself.</p>

<p>It is strange that a drummer of a regiment, or a
boatswain of a ship-of-war, may flog a man according
to the caprice of a colonel or a commander of twenty-five;
or the boatswain may hang him at the yard-arm,
according to the sentence of a court-martial, or he
shall die of the stripes he receives, yet the drummer
shall, in process of time, become drum-major and be a
fine gentleman, and the boatswain shall be a respectable
petty officer among his acquaintance; whilst
the Jack Ketch, who hangs a man, tried and condemned
by a grave judge and a conscientious jury, is
hooted at if he shows his face. Whence springs this
abhorrence in the one case, this courtesy in the other?
Is it that law, with its formalities, inspires more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
disgust than the passionate freaks of individual severity?
or have judge and jury, the real hangmen, had
the art to throw the odium of spilling blood on a poor
wretch, who is no more accessory to the act than the
hempen cord which he ties?</p>

<p>I recollect once, in November last, riding over to the
village of Jôon, to endeavour to persuade the goatherds,
who supplied my family with milk, to send it
with more regularity, having ineffectually requested
them to do so several times by the servant. It was,
I believe, on that day, when, in returning, I met
Messrs. Poujolat and Boutés, the two French travellers,
whose unsuccessful visit to Lady Hester Stanhope
has been already narrated. I do not know
whether other persons have made the observation, but
it has occurred to me that, in countries called despotic,
the lower orders give themselves more licence than
in those where it is supposed, from the nature of the
government, they possess greater impunity. The
reason of this perhaps may be that, as their obedience
to their superiors is regulated by the degree of fear in
which they hold them, so they are always ready to
disobey the injunctions of one superior at the command
of another who happens to be more powerful.
The consequence is, that no dependance can be placed
on the word of the Syrian peasantry for any regular
service required of them. A goatherd promised to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
supply me punctually with milk all the year through:
and he would probably have done so, if it had not
been that a greater man than myself sometimes came
to the village, who was fond of a bowl of milk for his
breakfast. This man was Hamâady, who was not to
be affronted with impunity: we were neglected therefore,
so long as he staid, and I found all arguments
vain against the terror of his formidable name.</p>

<p>Wednesday, April 25.—Lady Hester said to me
to-night, “I always considered you as a respectable
literary character—a little pedantic, and fond of showing
people what you know—and, therefore, cannot
but regret that you should have lost your energy, and
your understanding, and your memory, by the perfect
apathy to everything in which you are sunk. B. was
clever as a literary character, too; but then he always
affronted everybody by his immoderate pretensions:
they might be just, but then he had no indulgence for
any one. I always told him that people would never
fail to be silent before him, and he would get nothing
out of them; because I had observed at my father’s,
how extremely modest people of knowledge generally
were: they sat like scholars—I don’t mean like great
scholars, but like scholars of a schoolmaster. You
would spare a dunce, B. would not; and even sometimes
he was quite rude. One day he and Lord S.
were talking together, and Lord S. happened to say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
to some passage B. was quoting—‘I believe it is so;
when I was at college I could have told you, but
now I can’t exactly say:’ when B. continued, ‘Why,
you know Theocritus has a line,’ &amp;c.—‘Who is
Theocritus?’ I asked. ‘Madam,’ replied B., ‘I may
say of you what was once said of the <em>great</em> Lord
Chatham, as you call him, and whom you have been
talking about for these last two hours—I hardly know
which most to be astonished at, your extraordinary
genius, or your extraordinary ignorance.’</p>

<p>“Now, doctor, I always say I am a great dunce in
some things; for, though there are few persons who
have a quicker conception, a better judgment, and a
nicer discrimination, with a firmer decision, than I
have, yet, if I were to be taught for six hours things
that do not suit my capacity, I should forget them all
next morning, just as if I had never heard them:
and so I told Prince Pückler Muskau, when we almost
quarrelled about education. ‘Yes,’ I said, ‘you may
educate a horse, and make him put a kettle on the
fire, and drink tea, and dance a minuet on his <a id="chg7"></a>hind legs,
and a hundred things besides; but, leave him to
himself, and he will do nothing of the kind:’ and so it
is with the education of men. You may give a nobleman
a tutor, and, so long as his father is alive, for
fear he should be disinherited, or for fear of not marrying
some particular woman who has got a large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
fortune, or to drink his father’s champagne, or for
fear of being kicked out of society, he will keep to his
books and to appearances; but, as soon as his father
is dead, he’ll show himself what he really is, and, if
he is by nature a blackguard, the greater will he
prove in proportion to his rank. Such was Lord B.,
worse than a hackney-coachman; but if a man has
such vices as come from nature alone—as when a
peasant, from ambition, does things to rise in the
world which even are crimes, I can forgive him; or
if another, from an unaffected flow of spirits, must
get into society and get drunk, or, from an over-vigorous
constitution, becomes debauched, I can overlook
all this.</p>

<p>“I knew a man, who, seeing a family in distress,
out of sheer pity, gave bills for their relief, although
he must have been aware he could never repay a sixpence
of it: this may be swindling in the eyes of man,
but is it in the eyes of God? When a cold, artificial
character reads, and then assumes from books qualities
and appearances not his own, studies for debauchery’s
sake, runs after women for fashion and not from constitution—all
such performances I detest, and would
be the first to kick him out of society.</p>

<p>“I was acquainted with two persons in the great
world, one a lover of the Duchess of R., the other a
great politician in the House of Commons, and highly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
esteemed by his party: neither of them could write
a common note without making one or two blunders.
The former could not always spell his own name; for
I knew his tutor, and he assured me that his pupil, at
twenty, came to him sometimes to know if he had
written his signature properly. He once wrote me a
note so illegible, that all I could make out was that
my letters were better than Madame de Sevigné’s;
and then, with a scrawling hand, and with blots, he
contrived to hide his blunders: but the latter was so
fearful of betraying his ignorance, that, when any
particular question about politics required a long explanation,
he would evade it, if written to, by replying,
in five words, that he had had for some time thoughts
of going down in the country to visit his correspondent,
and he would then talk over the business. It is said
that the great Duke of Marlborough could not write a
despatch without a dozen errors in it: but here the
want of education did no harm. The lover could
always be understood enough to know that an assignation
was made, and the general that a victory had
been gained.</p>

<p>“Education is all paint—it does not alter the nature
of the wood that is under it, it only improves its appearance
a little. Why I dislike education so much
is that it makes all people alike, until you have examined
into them: and it sometimes is so long before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
you get to see under the varnish! Education, beyond
reading, writing, and arithmetic, is of no use to persons
who have shops to attend to, household duties to
perform, and indeed in all the ordinary occupations of
life. I told the prince that, in reality, my lord’s
gentleman and my lady’s-maid were much better off
than a clergyman or a doctor. The rooms they live
in, their fine wines, their dress, everything about them
is better; and what education do they want more
than keeping an account of their master’s and mistress’s
linen, and such trifling inventories? I cannot
let you remain in your error—an error so fatal to
everybody—that accomplishments and learning give
any decided advantage to their possessors; it is a
man’s star that effects all: if men are to be great,
they will be so as well without learning as with.
Why, there was Lord Hood and Lord Bridport, both
sons of country clergymen, with not more than a hundred
a year, and they surely could not have had much
education: for they robbed orchards, played the
truant, hated school, and were sent to sea: yet one
became a viscount with an immense fortune, and the
other a lord, but not so rich. There was no remarkable
talent in either—both were very honest men. Payne,
the smuggler’s son, whom I sent to sea, had no education;
but he had activity and luck, and made his
way. I had admired his discretion and intelligence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
as a lad; and when, at a time that Lord St. Vincent
had more prizes than he could well man, and Payne
was put into one of them, he boldly asked for himself
the command of it, little knowing that Lord St. Vincent
and Mr. Pitt did not like each other at all. ‘Who
are you, my brave lad?’ asked Lord St. Vincent.—‘Why,’
answered he, ‘Lady Hester Stanhope knows
me.’—‘You know Lady Hester Stanhope?’ said my
lord. ‘Yes,’ replied Payne, ‘I knew her at Deal,
and Mr. Pitt I know too, and that’s no bad recommendation.’—‘I
think so,’ cried Lord St. Vincent,
laughing, and appointed him.</p>

<p>“Now, take the reverse of the picture, and look at
the O***s, with their polished education and every
sort of accomplishment, and compare their splendid
misery—for misery I call it—with those I have mentioned.
There was Mrs. W*****, Lady A***, and
Mrs. B*******. Lady A. might be said to be well
off, as a baronet’s wife; but the other two!—I have
witnessed the anxious countenances of those people,
who, at every knock at the door, involuntarily turned
their eyes, as if expecting some troublesome dun or
some unpleasant news; and then, if the husband was
called out of the room, what a look the wife gave when
he came in again, as seemingly fearful something might
have happened! What a fool and abominable wretch
the Prince must have been, to go and invite himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
to dine with such people, when he knew he put them
to the expense of a quarter’s income!</p>

<p>“There you would see him at some party, at the
doorway of two rooms, speaking loudly to some one:—‘Well,
then, it’s all fixed; on Wednesday next I
dine with you, and shall bring about a dozen friends.’
‘Why does your royal highness say a dozen? let it
be fifteen.’—‘Well, a dozen—fifteen; but we shall
dine precisely at four.’ And there was the man’s wife,
standing breathless, with scarce strength to keep down
a suppressed sigh, thinking with herself, ‘What shall
we do, and how shall we provide for all this?’ Then
the husband, with a forced smile, would endeavour to
relieve her with, ‘My dear, did you hear? his royal
highness intends us the honour of dining with us on
Wednesday—you forget to thank him:’ and the poor
wife, who strains at a compliment, ill-worded from her
uneasiness—Oh! Lord!—oh! Lord, doctor, it has
made my heart ache.</p>

<p>“I recollect B******* going down into Kent, and
going round among the farmers to buy up chestnut
horses with white foreheads and white legs; and,
when he had got nine of them, he trimmed them up,
made them good-looking, and, by going about, pretending
first he would not sell them on any account,
then that he would sell them only for money down,
contrived to get a buyer for them, and sold them at a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
hundred pounds a pair, when he had given twenty-five,
thus getting himself a little claret and champagne for
the winter.</p>

<p>“These O***s were brought up from H. to be
married to the Prince’s friends; for you know men
will not go into society where there are no attractions
from women; and the Prince, who saw them, said,
‘You must get them to town into our parties:’ but
would they not have done better to have married some
country squire, where at least they would have had
their own mutton, a comfortable house, and plenty
around them?”</p>

<p>Thursday, April 26.—Lady Hester was in better
health, and in the best of humours: a gleam of sunshine
seemed for awhile to dispel the gloom which had
for so many months pervaded this unhappy abode. She
talked over the gay scenes of her early travels, in which
I had shared; of the festivities of Constantinople; reminded
me of the sea captains (as she was accustomed
to call them); of Mr. Fazakerly and Mr. Galley
Knight; then how Mr. Tom Sheridan fell on his
knees before her and made fine speeches at Malta; of
General Oakes’s splendid parties; how Mr. Frederick
North ran about in search of a —— he could not
find; and related a hundred anecdotes, which her
inexhaustible memory supplied at the suggestion of
the moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
She at last brought the conversation round to the
Prince Pückler Muskau. “Now do tell me, doctor,”
she continued, “what the Prince said of me; for, you
know, when they come to me, they all come with a
set speech and a prepared bow, that they may put
down in their book what passed; but I want you to
tell me how he comes into a room in a common way,
as when he paid your family a visit: what sort of a
bow does he make? He is a handsome man; but,
although his hands are very good and very white, I
don’t think them as good as old Pierre’s. What
beautiful fingers Pierre has got! and, with the dirty
work he has to do, they are even now white:—what
would they be if he wore gloves constantly? The
Prince’s nails are very good, but Pierre’s are incomparably
fine: his hand is like some of those you see
in the pictures at the Vatican; and, when it hangs
loose, with his arm extended, it falls at right angles
to his wrist—and all this with no intention on his
part: he never suspected even that I was looking at
them. Poor old Pierre! he walked about his room,
the maids say, praying for me half the night. I
have sent him home to his wife. I shall make him
up a basket of some potatoes and vermicelli, and
salmon, and some brawn—he likes brawn: and perhaps
we shall have some news how the Prince made
out at the Emir Beshýr’s.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
In fact, old Pierre was a regular spy, who, residing
at Dayr el Kamar, was sent for from time to time to
give an account of the visits of travellers to the Emir,
of their reception, and what they talked about. He
was not intentionally a spy; but, from his natural
garrulity, he always recounted what he had heard,
merely to please her ladyship, whom he knew to be
very fond of such gossip.</p>

<p>Lady Hester pursued her discourse, and asked me
if all the people now wore white gloves as the prince
did. “It must be,” she observed, “very expensive:
they can’t do with less than two pair a-day, which, at
half-a-crown a pair, is about £70 a-year. I calculate
it thus:—7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> in three days, 15<i>s.</i> in six, or one
week, and 60<i>s.</i> in a month:—that, with the odd days
left out in each week, will make about £70.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>“It is very odd,” she observed after a pause, “that
all those who write books say that I shake hands with
them: now, you know very well that I never do, and
that it is quite contrary to my manner—what can be
the reason of their saying so?” “But the Americans,”
I rejoined. “Oh!” cried she, “as for the Americans,
it was quite ridiculous. When the whole posse of
sixteen came with Commodore ——, I thought they
would have torn my arm off: not a simple shake,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
but” (and here she imitated their rough way of doing
it) “such as draymen would give. There were the
Commodore’s daughters too—rather pretty girls, but
ill dressed—something like Miss Williams; one with
a beautiful set of teeth, which she showed, gums and
all: but their clothes hung about them—you know
how I mean. They wanted to appear rather clever,
talking about the Sultan and his favourite, and having
all the Turkish names at their tongues’ ends. I don’t
know whether he talked to them, but I think he did:
just, you know, speaking to the father, and then saying,
‘Are these your daughters?’—in that way. As
for the Sultan’s favourite, he is a man to talk to anybody,
and laugh in his sleeve.”</p>

<p>Logmagi had come up, his new house being finished,
which Lady Hester had partly built, and nearly furnished
at her expense. “Now,” she said, “I shall
send him a voyage to sea, that he may do something
for himself—perhaps to Constantinople.” In my own
mind I conceived this to be some plan she had in contemplation
for getting news from that city, or to send
persons there, or to get somebody back—God knows
what! All that could be conjectured on such occasions
was, that there was something in the wind; but
foolish was he who troubled himself in divining what
it was; he was sure to be wide of the mark. Mystery
and secresy were ever necessary to her nature. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
plans were generally executed in the cause of humanity,
and with the most disinterested feelings:
sometimes they were political, and then might be
viewed in different lights, according to the party or
school in which men had been bred; but her tendency
for masking the most simple actions ran into
excess. All the common events of Beyrout must be
related to her with a mysterious air, as if nobody else
was privy to them. Had I never seen anybody from
day to day but her ladyship, I might have remained
for months in ignorance of what was the town talk.
If a dispute had happened among the military, if a
governor had been deposed, if the Pasha had arrived,
if a consul had died, all the every-day chat which, in
other houses, is as common as the tea and coffee on
the table—not one word of all this would you ever
hear from her lips: she made a disguise for things
which everybody must have known quite as well as
herself.</p>

<p>Lady Hester told me the cats had eaten up her
dinner. This reminds me that I have said nothing
of the prodigious number of these animals, which had
the run of her house and courtyards. I have counted
as many as thirty old cats and kittens, without including
those that haunted the store-rooms, the
granaries, the outhouses, and the gardens. It was
forbidden to molest them; and the consequence was,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
that neither fish, flesh, nor fowl, could be left for a
moment on a table or a shelf, but half-a-dozen cats
would be gnawing it or carrying it off. This was a
trifling nuisance, however, in comparison with their
caterwauling during their disputes, day and night,
which was at once most overpowering and most
ludicrous.</p>

<p>Lady Hester, before I left her, said, “You must
write a letter to M. Guys, and tell him the Prince
sent three times to the Emir Beshýr to say he was
coming, and three times put it off again. The Emir
will lay it upon me:—but you will see he will be as
humble to the Prince; so humble! for I think the
Prince has been instructed by Mahomet Ali to treat
him like a dog.” She seemed to be reflecting a little
while, and then resumed: “I don’t think Mahomet
Ali is coming here, as the Prince told you he was:
perhaps he has given out so, and will send that man,
who, you know, resembles him so much; a figure he
keeps to send out here and there, just to make his
appearance and go again, to frighten people at certain
places. He is so artful, doctor! he has tried to
make <i lang="fr">savants</i> of some of his women; he wanted some
Madame de Staëls. There is no saying what pains
he has taken to effect his purpose: I believe he would
have been glad to have had me. But, as I said to the
Prince, when he told me I ought to be on the throne<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
of England, I would not be queen of England, nor of
twenty Englands, if you could place me there:—all
that is too low for me. I prefer my corner of the
earth, with my own wild ideas, to being a shackled
sovereign, with a pack of fools about me; and you
may think it an odd speech to make, but such is the
case,—I am now above mortification and above ambition.
Those who have thought to mortify me have
been much mistaken: have you ever seen me mortified?”
To this question I was silent, at the time
not distinguishing in my mind the difference between
the indignation I had seen her manifest at the neglect
and baseness of some persons and the assumption of
some supposed superiority, which is quite a separate
ebullition of feeling. “If you have,” she repeated,
“say so:” then, reverting to Mahomet Ali, she went
on: “The viceroy is such a sharp man, doctor. Once
he wanted to find out how the women in his harým
conducted themselves, and he used to dress himself
as a common soldier, and, going to some of the tiptop
pimps of Cairo, he would say to them, ‘I should
like to get into such a house,’ naming some merchant
or aga’s; ‘I am but a common man, but I have had
the luck to find a treasure, and can pay you well for
your pains. Here is a large gold coin for you; it’s
ancient, and will not pass—but you can get it melted
down. I have many like it, and you shan’t want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
cash, if you will but introduce me into one or two
houses that I shall point out.’ By degrees, he would
talk of the viceroy’s harým, and so at last he would
obtain information, and find out who were the faithless
and intriguing ones among his own women.
What he did with them I don’t know, but he had
twelve of the pimps thrown into the Nile.</p>

<p>“But now, doctor, I see you are drowsy, so go to
bed and sleep, and then get up, and eat, and walk,
and ride, if those are the great pursuits of life. If I
die, I die; and if I live (as I think I shall yet), and
even if I am reduced to walk about in an old sack, so
that God but gives me strength enough to wear it,
I shall be perfectly contented. You have not profited
by my advice; but at least I have done my
duty; so, good night.”</p>

<p>After that she, as usual, resumed the conversation
for an hour: but who could write down all she said?
nay, it were better, perhaps, that even the little I
have recorded should have died with her, and have
never met the public eye: for, in endeavouring to
rescue her memory from the many unjust imputations
cast upon her actions during life, I may unwittingly
have entailed much odium, trouble, and reproach upon
myself.</p>

<p class="p2">Monday, April 30.—For three days I find a blank
in my diary. The fact is, I had been so much fatigued
for the last month that I threw my memorandums
aside, and, on retiring to my house, gave myself up to
the enjoyment of a little conversation with my family,
or else buried my cares and anxieties in sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
On the day when I paid my visit to Prince Pückler
Muskau in Sayda, he had asked me, in the course of
conversation, if I had been long in Syria, and whether
I had any intention of returning to Europe. I answered,
that I had come with the understanding of
remaining some months only, and probably should go
back in the summer. “But you will not leave my
lady whilst she is so ill?” he exclaimed. These
words of his were ever running in my mind. I saw
no prospect of Lady Hester’s realizing her hopes respecting
the property she supposed had been left her.
I was fairly worn off my legs by late hours, multiplied
occupations, and fruitless endeavours to soothe an
irritated and neglected, although a high-born and
gifted creature—the victim of fallen greatness, false
hopes, and superhuman efforts to effect vast projects of
philanthropy and political combinations on small
means and ruined resources. I was therefore anxious
to close my labours, and retire to the obscurity from
which she had called me: but still the fatal words—“You
will not leave my lady whilst she is so ill”—recurred
to my thoughts, and I knew not what to do.
Lady Hester would often say to me—“You are of no
use to me: what good do you do me? I was just as
well without you.”—But, during a long period of
thirty years, in which I was either with, or in correspondence
with her, I had good reason for believing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
that I had been of much service to her, both as
respected her health and her affairs—indeed I may
say, without presumption, of greater service than any
other person. This was felt by everybody around
her; and throughout all her dilemmas and illnesses,
the constant cry was—“My lady, you must send for
the doctor: there is nobody suits you or understands
your constitution so well as he does.” That I was
devotedly attached to her, the best part of a life spent
in her service will sufficiently testify; but I was now
grown too old and infirm to be equal to the task of
meeting her constant calls on my time and my energies:
I had become nervous. Doctor C., an Englishman,
had fled from her dwelling, fearing to be
poisoned by her villanous servants; yet I had much
greater reason to apprehend such a fate than he had:
for the cook (who dressed my family dinner every
day,) was the particular object of Lady Hester’s suspicions
in what regarded the enormous waste of stores;
and, although not entertaining the same suspicions
myself, (from having had him once as my own servant,
and having kept my eye upon him for some years,
and from knowing also that there were worse depredators
living in the house;) still, as she directed her
daily attacks against him, and even said I suffered
him to rob her by the forbearance I showed in not
having him chastised, I was worked up, on many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
occasions, into a state of excitement against him that
carried me beyond all restraint, and necessarily made
me hateful in his eyes, inasmuch as he considered me
the principal hindrance to his peculations. I had
rated him in unmeasured terms for his rascality, and
the hot-blooded children of the East do not easily forget
or forgive such language. All this anxiety could
not render a man gay, and I wasted away visibly to
the eye. I had nobody to confide in; for I studiously
concealed all these vexations from my family, and endeavoured
to put on a cheerful air before them, when
my mind was far from being tranquil. Can it be
wondered at, therefore, if I looked to Europe with a
longing desire of returning thither?</p>

<p>But the prince had said, “You will not surely leave
her whilst she is <em>so ill</em>:” and I was constantly reiterating
to myself, “How can I leave her whilst she
is <em>so poor</em>?” Her embarrassed circumstances, now that
my stay with her could be considered as disinterested,
seemed to be an insuperable barrier to my departure.
Had she been rich, I need not have used any ceremony:
the state of my health, now that hers was
somewhat improved, would have been a sufficient plea:
but she was known to be short of money and beset
with creditors; and to leave her would seem to be the
result of a mercenary calculation. Under all these
circumstances, I held my peace, and was resolved to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
remain, as long as I thought my presence could be
either useful or consolatory to her.</p>

<p>The first subject of conversation to-day was this
very cook’s peculations: “What am I to do?” said
Lady Hester; “if nobody will help me, I’ll go myself,
and stand from morning to night in the kitchen,
and see everything come and go. Here am I ruined,
because those about me are so proud and so particular
about their dignity that they can’t put their heads
into a kitchen. I presume your father was not better
than Mr. Cooper of Sevenoaks; and, if he had had
a son, a doctor, I’ll venture to say he would not have
been so mighty fine.” Here her thoughts were luckily
carried away from the vile cook to Mr. Cooper, and
she went on: “What beautiful teams of gray horses
Mr. Cooper had! There was a boy, who used to ride
on one of the dray-horses dressed in green; a little
fellow, who, having seen the Prince of Wales drive
through Sevenoaks, going somewhere, set off by himself
one fine day for London, found out where the
Prince lived, and went and knocked at the gate of
Carlton House. The porter was a giant, and wanted
to know what the boy knocked so loudly for: he
said he had something to say to the Prince of Wales.
The porter called him an impudent little scoundrel,
and told him to go about his business; but the boy
would not go, and the fight between the giant and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
this Tom Thumb made a sort of an uproar: upon
which the Prince, who was at dinner, inquired what
was the matter, and desired that the young urchin
might be brought in; who, nothing abashed, being
asked what he wanted, said that, having seen the
Prince’s fine servants go along the road, he had come
to London to be one of them; the Prince said very
well, and sent him to the stables. Doctor, he became
an excellent groom, and was afterwards for many
years one of his best coachmen.”</p>

<p>This anecdote seemed to have tranquillized Lady
Hester’s mind, as was generally the case when she
talked about old times. She proposed that I should
read a little of Lady Charlotte Bury’s novel, the
“Memoirs of a Peeress.” After listening to a few
pages, at the mention of some incident, interrupting
me, she said:—“Ah! that was Lady B., who placed a
cast of the statue of Antinous amidst myrtle-pots in a
vestibule of her house: she had ten times more cleverness
than her sister the duchess. The duchess’s reputation
was, in great part, the effect of her position:
for fine horses, fine carriages, and that <i lang="fr">éclàt</i> that attends
a great personage wherever she goes, made up
the greatest part of it. Why, she sometimes would
employ her own people to puff her off. You would
see a man in a shop in Bond Street say to the people
of the shop—‘Whose fine carriage is that yonder?’—‘That’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
the Duchess of **********’s, sir,’ the shopman
would reply. Then another man, pretending to
be a stranger to the first, would cry out, ‘Good God!—the
Duchess of **********; do let me look: I
would give more to get a sight of her grace than I
would of the king.—Pray, excuse me; I shall be back
in a moment;’—and off he would run.</p>

<p>“The Duchess of **********, when she did not
smile, had something satanic in her countenance.
Then her affectation was so high charged. No matter
to whom—to a dirty clerk of the Foreign Office—she
would say, ‘If you would be so very good,
sir, just to give yourself the trouble to deliver this
note—I am sure you are so kind a looking gentleman.’
And then she would speak in French to whoever
was with her—‘<i lang="fr">Quels beaux yeux! ne le trouvez
vous pas? C’est un bel homme, n’est ce pas?</i>’ just as if
the clerks in the Foreign Office might not know
French.”</p>

<p>Wednesday, May 2, 1839.—To-day, as was usual
on Wednesdays, I did not see Lady Hester until
after sunset; but dinner was scarcely over, when
came the accustomed message of “The Syt will be
glad to see you as soon as you are at liberty?” She
could not bear to be alone: and I was, therefore, summoned
that she might have somebody to talk to. She
made inquiries whether the dinner had been to our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
liking; whether the tartlets and bread-pudding were
well cooked; and, on such occasions, I always knew
she had been lecturing the cook about his negligence,
and answered accordingly, anxious, if possible, to
avoid the broils which kept the house in a continual
uproar; but I seldom succeeded in averting them entirely;
for, after having manifested her anxiety about
my family’s comfort, she would begin about her own,
with—“Thus it is: I am obliged to look after everybody’s
dinner, and am left to starve myself.” She
then launched out into her customary complaints,
and told me how she had contrived the means of at last
bringing her maids down; for she had ordered a thing
to be made like a clothes’ horse, which was to stand in
her room with a sheet hanging over it, behind which
the maids were to take turns to wait alternately, hour
by hour, that she might be sure she had them within
call: “for,” said she, “if they will not move fast
enough when I ring, I’m determined I’ll keep them
on their legs, one or the other, all day; and I have
told them I put them behind a screen that I may
not see their ugly faces. That beast, Sâada, scratches
herself before me, just like an Italian or a Frenchman:
I have never been used to such behaviour in servants,
and will not bear it.</p>

<p>“When I recollect how differently servants conduct
themselves in England! There was the groom of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
chamber at Mr. Pitt’s—I don’t think I ever held
half an hour’s conversation with him the whole time
he was there; he was, however, a man with quite a
distinguished look, and ten times more of a gentleman
than half those who call themselves so. He came in,
delivered a note or a message with a proper air; and,
if I had one to send anywhere, I threw it along the
table to the end, so,” (and here Lady Hester put on
one of those—what shall I call them?—queen-like
airs, which she was fond of assuming)—“or else gave
it into his hand, telling him, or not telling him—for he
could see by looking at it—where it was to go. Do
you think servants ever dared to smile, or scratch
themselves, or seem to notice anything, as these beasts
do? He afterwards married one of the maids, and
took Thomas’s, or some such named, hotel, where he
was well patronized by the great.</p>

<p>“Servants work twice as hard in England as they
do here. Why, there was the boy of twelve or thirteen
years old that used to go to Sevenoaks to fetch
papa’s letters. Every day but one in the week did
that boy ride backward and forward; and sometimes
I have seen him lifted off his horse, with his fingers so
benumbed that he could not even ring the bell; and
his face and hands were rubbed with snow, and he was
walked about for a quarter of an hour before he was
allowed to go into the servants’ hall. There was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
shepherd’s daughter, who would take up a sheep over
her shoulders, and carry it like a nothing; ay, and
whilst it was struggling, too, pretty stoutly, I can tell
you. Then the washerwomen, who used to begin on
Monday morning half an hour after midnight, and
work all through the day and the next night until
eleven or twelve, without ever sitting down, except to
their meals:—there was hard work! Here they have
their sleep in the middle of the day, and will not eat
or drink when they are warm, for fear of getting the
lampas.”</p>

<p>Thursday, May 3.—I read a few more pages of
Lady Charlotte Bury’s novel. The Duchess of Rochester
was now set down as Lady J. “Those girls
of hers,” observed Lady Hester, “were brought up
so prim. I recollect seeing three of them sitting
together in a box at the Opera, and nothing could be
more beautiful. They had charming countenances,
with fine eyes, very good teeth, and complexions quite
ravishing; but none of them were remarkably clever.”</p>

<p>The narrative comes to where Mrs. Fitzirnham
regrets how she was taking her pleasure, and putting
her husband to the expense of hiring a country-house
for her, when she should have been at home saving
his money. “Ah!” said Lady Hester, “she should
have been making his shirts;” and this text afforded
her an opportunity of pronouncing an encomium on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
Lady Mahon,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> her brother’s wife. “She had,” said
Lady Hester, “one good point about her, that, after
her marriage, whilst my brother was poor, she was not
extravagant:” then, reverting to other branches of
her family, she dwelt for some time on the merits and
demerits of them all, until she came round again to
her brother and to his father-in-law. “Yes,” she
said, “giving Lord Carrington a peerage was one of
Mr. Pitt’s errors. I once asked Mr. Pitt if he did not
repent of making so many peers; and he answered, if
he had to go over his time again, he never would;
‘Age, Hester,’ said he, ‘brings experience.’ But he
was in such a situation, that, to prevent a revolution
in England, or to hinder England from becoming a
province of France, he was obliged to patch up things
as he could. He was like an ambassador, going in ill-health
to some distant court on a mission of importance,
and who would say to his physician, ‘You must
patch me up in the best way you can for this journey;
so that I get to the end of it, never mind what becomes
of me.’ England at that time was not like France:
the latter was obliged to go through a salivation; the
former only wanted a dose of physic. Besides, fancy,
what a revolution would have been in England. I
have seen what an English mob is at an election:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
they are the most horrid set I have ever beheld: a
word will lead them any way; and as for reason, they
will never listen to it. But there, doctor, go on with
the book: it interests me, when I think who wrote it,
and what we are both come to.”</p>

<p>I read on, until we came to where mention is made
of a footman’s nosegay on a levée day. Upon this,
Lady Hester remarked, “My footman always used to
give a guinea for his on the Queen’s birthday. When
you consider,” she added, “what those footmen spent
in nosegays and silk stockings, and bags, and shoe-buckles,
it was a pretty round sum. As for the fine
ladies who make such a show in the fashionable world,
I have known some of them borrow five guineas of
their footmen. I sometimes went down to Putney,
and shut myself up not to be seen, that I might not
spend all my money on rich dresses; but I saved it
for other purposes, to give away to poor people.”</p>

<p>As the work proceeded, I came to the account of
Fitzirnham’s sufferings and his approaching dissolution:
she told me to skip all that—“I don’t wish
to hear it,” she said; “it is too melancholy.” Alas!
I felt it applied to Mr. Pitt’s and to her own
situation too much not to give her pain: so, shutting
the book, I tried to converse on some other subject,
but her thoughts still reverted to what I had been
reading about. At last she broke out in these words:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
“Poor Mr. Pitt! one of the nourishing things they
gave him before his death was the yolk of an egg beat
up so thick with pounded sugar that it was quite stiff:
‘I wonder,’ said the footman who prepared it for him,
‘that they persist in giving him the egg; for he
brings it up every time.’” Lady Hester went on:—“Mr.
Pitt died in the night, doctor.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Dr. Bailey
acquainted me with his impending death the day before:
Sir Walter Farquhar kept saying to the last
that I need not afflict myself—always giving me hopes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
The carriages had been waiting at the door, ready for
a long time: as soon as all was over, Williams and
James,” (her brother) “set off for Downing Street,
and sealed up everything. Miss Williams then took
just what clothes she wanted for me, and they both returned
to Putney, bringing with them Mr. Adams,
Mr. Pitt’s secretary, whom they called up at his house
in Queen Street, Westminster. On their way back
they met the doctors going to town.”</p>

<p>I happened to observe that I had read an account
of Mr. Pitt’s last moments in Gifford’s Life of him,
and that his dying words, praying for forgiveness
through the merits of his Redeemer, or words to that
effect, together with the whole scene of his death-bed,
appeared, as I thought, too much made up, and too
formal to be true: leaving the impression that the
author, and those from whom he gathered his information,
had considered it a duty to make the close of a
great man’s life conformable to their religious feelings
rather than to facts and reality.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> “Who is it that
says it of him?” asked Lady Hester. “Dr. Prettyman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
and Sir Walter Farquhar.”—“Oh! it’s all a
lie,” she replied, rather indignantly:—“Dr. Prettyman
was fast asleep when Mr. Pitt died: Sir Walter
Farquhar was not there; and nobody was present but
James. I was the last person who saw him except
James, and I left him about eight o’clock, for I saw
him struggling as if he wanted to speak, and I did not
like to make him worse.” After a short pause, she
resumed:—“What should Mr. Pitt make such a
speech for, who never went to church in his life?
Nothing prevented his going to church when he was
at Walmer: but he never even talked about religion,
and never brought it upon the carpet.</p>

<p>“When I think of poor Mr. Pitt, I am the more
and more persuaded that the greater part of mankind
are not worth the kindness we bestow on them. Never
did so pure an angel enter upon life as he: but, good
God! when he died, had he had to begin the world
again, he would have acted in a very different manner.
The baseness and ingratitude that he found in mankind
were inconceivable. All the peers that he had
made deserted him, and half those he had served returned
his kindness by going over to his enemies.</p>

<p>“Then see, doctor, what fortune and luck are!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
Mr. Pitt, during his life spent in his country’s service,
could seldom get a gleam of success to cheer him,
whilst a Liverpool and a Castlereagh have triumphs
fall upon them in showers. Oh! it makes me sick
to think that Mr. Pitt should have died through hard
labour for his country; that Lord Melville, so hearty
as he was, should almost have sunk under it, and
should have had nothing but difficulties and disappointments;
whilst such fellows as H. and C., who do
not care if the country were ruined, provided they
kept their places, should have nothing but good fortune
attend them, as if it was the effect of their stupid
measures. But, not contented with that, they must
even bring discredit on his memory by attributing
to him a line of conduct he never pursued. To think
of Canning’s going about and saying, ‘This is the
glorious system of Pitt;’ and the papers echoing his
words—‘this is the glorious system of Pitt!’ Why,
when Louis XVIII. came to England, Mr. Pitt would
not receive him as King, but only as Count Somebody,
(I declare I forget what, it made so slight an impression
on me;) and when I used to say to Mr. Pitt,
‘Oh, Lord! what does it signify?—do let him be
king if he wants it’—‘No,’ replied Mr. Pitt, ‘I am
not fighting to re-establish the Bourbons on the throne:
only let the French have some stable government
that we can make peace with, that’s all; I am not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
going to sacrifice the interests of my country to the
Bourbons, Hester.’”</p>

<p>I quitted her about three o’clock, when she said she
was going into the bath, which she did about every
third day; no proper place certainly for her in her
state of health.</p>

<p>In crossing the courtyard to go to my house, there
seemed somehow to be an unusual solitude about the
premises. The stories, too, I had been hearing and
reading were doleful; so that I became very melancholy
for the rest of the day, and could not rally
my spirits, do what I would. As I sat in my room, I
reflected that, although Lady Hester would probably
get through the summer, yet how surely, though
slowly, disease was making irreparable inroads on her
reduced frame.</p>

<p>May 8.—My fears about the servants now began to
revive. Monsieur Guys had made his preparations
for his departure, and was going in a few days to
Aleppo—he, who knew all her servants, their names,
where they had sprung from, and everything about
them, and who, had they committed any crime, could
have at once traced them to their hiding-places. I felt
my loneliness: I had no one to look to, to help me in
any great difficulty. I saw, when I returned from a
walk, or entered the house unexpectedly, how the older
ones were often sitting in close cabal together, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
heard their whispers, like conspirators laying their
heads together for some evil purpose. Why had I
not written down more for these last three days? I
said to myself, when I saw the scantiness of my
memorandums: alas! my mind was ill at ease.</p>

<p>The name of Sir Francis Burdett was often mentioned,
and various conjectures formed to account for
his long silence. The prince, who had promised to
write, where was he got to? Every hope seemed to
fail. The prince, when he left Lady Hester Stanhope,
had been entrusted with a copy of the correspondence,
such as it afterwards appeared in the newspapers, and
he had undertaken to make it public: she was therefore
in daily expectation of receiving information from
him of its transmission to Europe, and through what
channel it would appear. But no letter came, and
this rendered her fidgety and uneasy; for she conceived
it to be of vital importance to her interests that
her case should be made known as speedily as possible,
hoping, from publicity, to come more speedily at the
truth about the property to which she thought herself
entitled, and which, she supposed, was withheld from
her.</p>

<p>The time meanwhile was beguiled in reading Lady
Charlotte Bury’s novel, which, from the remarks and
anecdotes it called forth, lasted out much longer than
it would with a common reader. In that part of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
“Memoirs” where mention is made of the doubts that
existed as to the validity of the Duke of Rochester’s
will, Lady Hester observed, “A person, who is in the
daily habit of writing like another, might easily imitate
his signature. Mr. Pitt, when I had written
a paper, used to say, ‘Sign it for me,’ and I did;
because, when you write quickly, you write like another
if you will. It is those who sit down to forge,
and make their strokes slowly, that are found out,
because there is an uncertainty in what they do.”</p>

<p>Something else called forth another observation:
“Oh!” said Lady Hester, “I used very often to tell
Mr. Pitt ‘<em>You</em> are not the grand statesman; it was
your father;—you are a little God Almighty sent
from Heaven, who are always thinking of the respect
due to the king, of complaisance to the peers, and who
kill yourself out of compassion: <em>he</em> made them all
tremble.’ Nevertheless, doctor, I know that he thought
just as his grandfather did.”</p>

<p>Wednesday, May 9.—I resumed reading at that part
where Squire Mordaunt returns to Spetchingly on
New-year’s Day. When the narrative comes to Mrs.
de Vere’s meeting with Mr. Fox, Lady Hester said,
“Fox, I think, was thrown into a position with the
Prince and his dissipated friends from which he never
afterwards could extricate himself, otherwise he would
have been a different man; but, mixed up with them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
the king never could bear him: for, when Mr. Pitt
took office in 1803, the king wrote to him (for I saw
the letter,) ‘Would you force on me Mr. Fox, who
debauched my son?’ &amp;c. The last time I saw Mr.
Fox, he was at Vauxhall with Mrs. Fox. She was
dressed as some respectable housekeeper might be,
with a black bonnet and some sort of a gown. I
looked at her several times, but I could see nothing
like what I should have expected in Mrs. Armstead:
there was none of that manner.—” (here Lady Hester
made up a kind of courtezan look that conveyed what
she meant to say.) “Mr. Fox looked like the landlord
of a public-house; yet, when he spoke, doctor, he
was sometimes very eloquent. On Mr. Hastings’s
trial he made many people cry. There were all the
peers with their pocket-handkerchiefs out—quite a
tragedy! but he made such a business of it—” (here
Lady Hester sat up in bed, and, to show what she
meant, threw her arms first to the right and then to
the left, and then thumped the bed violently, making
me wonder where she had found such strength;)—“he
was worse than Punch.”</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott was mentioned in one place in
the novel with great praise. “I’m not sure about
Scott,” observed Lady Hester: “he pretended to be
a great Pittite, but he was half inclined to go over to
Fox. He sent some of his poetry, where he praised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
Fox, before he published it, to say he would not publish
it, if it were displeasing; but I told him he was
to do just as he liked, and to let it stand, as it made
no difference what he wrote.”</p>

<p>Thursday, May 10.—Lady Hester Stanhope was
very low to-day, seemingly exhausted with coughing,
when I saw her about one o’clock. She continued to
follow her own mode of cure, which now consisted in
swallowing the yolks of fresh eggs, sucking oranges by
dozens, sipping finjàns of strong coffee with ambergris
in it, and drinking small glasses of rum and milk.
Her food was of the most objectionable kind. She
thought, as many others do, that what are reputed
strong viands give strength to the body, without the
slightest regard as to whether the stomach could digest
and assimilate them so as to afford nourishment.
Thus she often had meat pies, eating the meat and
jelly, forced meat balls, beef cabóbs, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Shaykh Mohammed Nasýb, a Mograbyn, whom I
had sent away on the 19th of April without a present,
made his appearance again to-day. He had been to
the Emir Beshýr and to other great persons in the
mountain, to collect a hundred piasters or two here
and there, a practice common with these shaykhs
versed in the Mahometan religion and in the commentaries
on the Alcoran. They go from palace to
palace, are lodged and fed for a night or two, discourse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
with the great man once or twice a day, if he
is at liberty, and repay the hospitality they receive
either by their learning, or by their skill as alchymists,
or as astrologers, or by the news they bring
from the cities they have passed through, and of the
great men they have seen: for they find admission
everywhere.</p>

<p>The dervises are another set of visitors, very frequent
in the houses of the rich. They are the mendicant friars
of the East, itinerant monks, whose pretensions to
sanctity are heightened by a strange costume. Some
of them—for they are of different orders—let their
hair and beards grow long and hang dishevelled, and
wear black and shaggy sheep or bear or tiger skins.
By their side hang a score of strange-looking implements—a
carved cup in wood, a back-scratcher, to
facilitate the chase after vermin in parts where their
hands cannot easily reach, a pottle for water, a bullock’s
horn, or a conch shell to blow instead of it, long
rosaries of immense beads, an ostrich’s egg—God
knows what! They are all impudent, intrusive beggars,
and are well known and appreciated in the East
as the Franciscans, Capuchins, and other friars, are
in the West, who are but the humble imitators of
their more audacious, and, let me say, cleverer prototypes.</p>

<p>It was on a winter’s day that one of these people,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
being refused a night’s lodging and a bakshysh at
Lady Hester’s, invoked a curse on the house and its
inmates. He took his horn from his side, blew three
or four blasts, and uttered some imprecations which
were unintelligible to me. The whole scene was a
picture. He was a dervise of the order called Bektashy,
daring and fearless as men are who know that
none will venture to lay hands on them, athletic, with
raven locks of disproportionate thickness and length,
and clad in as wild-looking garments as the imagination
of a stage-manager could invent for Caliban, or
some such monster. His large, rolling eye, his features
darkened by a weather-beaten existence, his
white teeth, his shaggy and hairy breast, his naked
feet and legs, and his strange accoutrements, made
him altogether a remarkable being. The wind blew
high at the time, the rain swept up through the valley
from the sea in a white sheet, as the squalls every
now and then succeeded each other; and there he
stood, under the cover of a dilapidated building, which
those who have visited Dar Jôon may recollect as
being near the entrance gate. He had been fed with
a good dinner—for nobody ever came without having
something to eat put before him—but he had heard
that other dervises had left the house with fifty, a
hundred, nay, even two hundred piasters, and he
expected to force a compliance with his demands for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
himself. It must not be imagined that the servants
beheld this action of his, and heard his anathema,
with the same indifference that I did: they looked
gloomy and apprehensive. It so happened that some
pewits, or green plovers, had appeared in the mountain
and in our neighbourhood just about the same
time. The melancholy cry of these birds, as they are
not common in Syria, is considered of bad augury by
the Turks. It was in the month when Lady Hester
was in the worst stage of her illness; and they coupled
these things together, and drew from them unfavourable
omens. But Lady Hester had said to me—“Keep
away, if you can, all those shaykhs and
dervises; it will only torment me to know they are
there, for I can’t see them. I have no money to give
them, and they are too cunning to trust their news
and information, if they have any to give, to anybody
but me.” I was determined, therefore, to send him
off; the more so, as I did not like his physiognomy,
and as the village was close at hand, where he would
find a night’s lodging in the khan or caravansery.</p>

<p>But let us return to the Mograbyn shaykh. When
I told him that Lady Hester was ill, and could see
nobody, he said, if I would but let her know who he
was, he was sure she would receive him: that he had
several times had the honour of an audience, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
her Felicity had expressed herself so pleased with his
conversation as once to have engaged him to quit Zyb,
where he lived, and to come and settle at Jôon with his
family. I therefore represented this to her ladyship,
but she refused to see him. The circumstance, however,
gave rise to the following conversation:—</p>

<p>“People,” said she, “never should be sent away
who show a very great earnestness to be admitted;
for, although many times they might be but beggars,
sometimes it was not so. When my grandfather was
ill, a man on horseback came to the door and insisted
on seeing him. My grandmamma presented herself,
and asked him what was his business, telling him
Lord Chatham was so ill that he could receive nobody.
The man signified that nothing would do, but he must
see Lord Chatham himself. After ineffectually trying
to induce him to disclose his business, grandmamma
Chatham at last admitted him into my grandfather’s
room, but behind a screen, so that they were still
invisible to each other. ‘That will not do,’ observed
the persevering man; ‘I must see your lordship’s
face, and be sure it is you.’ The screen being removed,
and the man assured of whom he was speaking
to, drew out a tin case, containing the will of Sir Something
Pynsent, leaving my grandfather two estates,
one in Wiltshire, of £4,000 a year, and the other,
Burton Pynsent, of £10,000; his will only saying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
he had done it in admiration of his character. The
Wiltshire estate was sold immediately, and the money
frittered away (as I heard from Mr. Wilson, the
tutor) nobody knows how. Of the pictures my grandfather
only reserved two, the portraits of the Marquis
of Granby and of Admiral Saunders, to give to the
corporation of Plymouth. Of the rest, which were
old family pictures, like Lady Cobham, &amp;c., he took
no notice whatever.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Thursday, May 11.—I read to Lady Hester for
three hours out of the “Memoirs of a Peeress.” As
she lay on her bed, pale, wan, and exhausted, she
looked like a person in the last stage of illness; but,
as the day advanced, she generally grew more animated.
She made few remarks. The Duchess of Rochester
now was become the Marchioness of T*******.
The “jokes of Stowe,” as alluded to in the Memoirs,
she exemplified in this way: “One morning, whilst
General Grenville was staying there, there came a
letter, with his address on the cover, and ‘Montrose’
in the corner. The general, not being intimate with
the duke, said—‘What’s this? let’s see: what can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
make the duke write to me?’ On opening the letter,
out came about fifty fleas, all jumping up to his face.
The general’s extreme aversion to fleas was well known:
he was so angry at this that he ordered a postchaise,
and never would go to Stowe again. On Lord Glastonbury
they played a joke of another sort: they
put a paragraph in the papers, with initials and other
indications, that he had run off to Gretna Green. His
aversion to women and to marriage was as great as the
general’s aversion to fleas.”</p>

<p>As I read on, the old squire’s death affected Lady
Hester. “How rare is such a character now!” said
she: “I recollect some in my time. There was Sir
John Dyke, who was an excellent man, but careless
in his affairs, and perhaps ruined by this time. But
such men, when you get over the first two or three
days, in which a few expressions may be strange in
their conversation, become afterwards most agreeable
society, and have much sterling worth. They are
men who know something, and have real straitforwardness
of character: I always liked them.”</p>

<p>In another place she said—“Doctor, when you
reflect on this book, don’t you see the wide difference
there is between refined people and vulgar ones?
There is Lady Isabella and Lady Helen, with a
tyrannical and unkind mother—see how obedient and
submissive they are; and, I dare say, though the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
daughters of a duchess, had she put them to do the
most menial offices, they would have done them; but
vulgar people are always fancying themselves affronted,
and their pride is hurt, and they are afraid of being
lowered, and God knows what. You will think it a
strange thing to say, but it is my opinion that the
vices of high-born people are better than the virtues of
low-born ones. By low-born I do not mean poor
people; for there are many without a sixpence who
have high sentiments. It is that, among the low-born,
there is no spring of action that is good, even in their
virtues. If they are laborious and industrious, it is
for gain, not for the love of labour; if they are learned,
it is from pedantry; if they are charitable, it is from
ostentation; if religious, from hypocrisy; if studious
of health, it is to gratify their gormandizing; and so
on. I repeat it again—the vices of the great are preferable
to the virtues of such persons. Those of them
that rise in the world always show their base origin:
for if you kill a chicken and pick the feathers, they
may fly up into the air for a time, but they fall down
again upon the dunghill. The good or bad race must
peep out. God created certain races from the beginning;
and, although the pure may be crossed, and the
cart-horse be taken out of the cart and put to the
saddle, their foals will always show their good or bad
blood. High descent always shows itself, and low<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
always will peep out. I never have known above two
or three persons of common origin who had not something
vulgar about them.”</p>

<p>It was curious to hear how she would quote the
opinion of the commonest persons as affirmative of her
notions in this respect. “A peasant told me, one
day,” said Lady Hester, in a conversation on this
subject, “that he had met Captain —— on the road,
in his way to some part of the mountain; and I asked
him what he thought of him. ‘Why,’ replied the
man, ‘there is something of good blood about him,
and something that is not: he is half thorough-bred
and half <i>kedýsh</i>:’” (The reader has already been told
that <i>kedýshes</i> are horses of no pedigree, used by shopkeepers
and pedlars for the road:) “and the man was
right,” added Lady Hester. “But, only think, what
quickness of observation these people have: you cannot
deceive them; for, at a glance, they discover at once
what a man is. The girls, too, said Captain —— is not
quite <i>akâber</i>:” (akâber means distinguished in appearance)
“he has a third part of a bad breed in him: and
they were right as well as the peasant; for his mother
was a Miss ——, because his father, disappointed
in marrying Miss ——, whom Lord O—— danced
with at a ball and married the next day, went and
married a young lady well brought up, but not thorough
bred. He took his marines to the Emir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
Beshýr on horseback; horse marines, doctor!—and the
natives to this day talk with astonishment of the
calves of the legs of one of the officers who was with him.</p>

<p>“Did you ever know a better proof again how high
descent will show itself than in what I believe I told
you about Count Rewisky? When coming to see me
from Beyrout, he was met by a common shepherd, of
whom he asked the road to Sayda. The count was
dressed like a Bedouin Arab, and was mounted on a
shabby mare, of good blood, it is true, but to all
appearance not worth a hundred piasters. The
shepherd, looking at him, replied, ‘Sir, you don’t
want to go to Sayda; it is the way to Jôon you want
to know. You are going to see the English <i>meleky</i>’
(queen); ‘for a man of your rank is fitting only to be
her guest.’ This was exactly the case; he was coming
to see me; and, mean and poor as his appearance was,
the peasant detected his noble blood at a glance.</p>

<p>“That noble-minded man, doctor, was a perfect
convert to my opinions. He assured me that I had
appeared to him at different times, and once in particular
he told me the following story. He had been
in conversation with the Emperor Alexander on a
state affair of great importance, and the Emperor had
tried to induce him to do something which the Count
felt was the course he ought not to pursue as a man of
integrity, and he begged to be allowed some little time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
for consideration before he acceded to the Emperor’s
wishes. Alexander dismissed him, hoping that, by
the next day, when he would see him again, the Count
would recollect himself, and who he (the Emperor)
was. Count Rewisky, fretted almost to death, between
the ruin he might bring on his family, if he opposed
the Emperor’s wishes, together with the prospect of
Siberia, and the stings of conscience, still wanted
resolution to follow the path of virtue. But at night,
when he was in bed, I, as he told me, appeared to him
with a star on my forehead, and said to him—‘Count,
follow the road which conscience shows you is the right
one, and fear nothing.’ The next day, the Count
presented himself at the Emperor’s closet.—‘Who is
that?’ said a voice from within, and Alexander himself
opened the door. He started, when he saw the
Count. ‘Well,’ said he, ‘I trust you have got a
little sense into your head since yesterday: you have
changed your mind, no doubt.’—‘My mind, sire, remains
unchanged,’ said the Count.... ‘What a
fine black horse that was I saw you riding two or three
days ago—such a beautiful creature!’ cried the Emperor,
turning the conversation suddenly; and he never
after mentioned the subject to the Count.”</p>

<p>Sunday, May 13.—I did not see Lady Hester until
three o’clock in the afternoon. “Read to me,” she
said, almost as soon as I had sat down, “for I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
too exhausted to talk.” I began, in the “Memoirs of
a Peeress,” at the chapter succeeding the burial of the
squire, and she listened for some time without saying
a word. At last she interrupted me, and observed
that there was a great deal of good feeling in the book.
“If I were rich enough,” she continued, “I would
invite Lady Charlotte here—and she would come, for
she has children, and would like to show them the
East. How pleasant it would be for me to have such
a companion for two or three hours a day! What a
beautiful woman she was! what an arm and hand! I
have seen the whole Opera-House turn to look at it on
the front of the box. What a beautiful leg, too!—but
the handsomest foot I ever saw in man or woman
was Lord Down’s. The last time I ever met Lady
Charlotte was walking with her brother in Kensington
Gardens: she walked so well!—not mincing, like some
women, nor striding, like others, but with a perfect use
of her limbs, unaffected and graceful. The duke, too,
was like her in that respect: his smile was incomparably
sweet. I don’t know where they were going;
but they walked up to a party, seemed to talk and
inquire about somebody, and then walked away together.
Her features were equally charming with her
person—with hair not <i>keteety</i>” (the Arabic for
hempy), “but approaching to a gold colour, and with
a beautiful nose.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
The narrative proceeded to the remarks made on
the Empress Josephine. “There, you see,” exclaimed
Lady Hester, interrupting me, “was I right
about Josephine? As soon as I saw that print of her,
which you sent me, I saw at once she was artful beyond
measure: I told you so, you know, some time
ago. There are two or three lines about her face that
make me think she was satanic: as for being handsome,
that she never could have been. But Buonaparte,
whatever Lady Charlotte may think, had
naturally something vulgar in his composition. He
took a little from Ossian, a little from Cæsar, a little
from this book, a little from that, and made up a
something that was a good imitation of a great man;
but he was not in himself naturally great. As for
killing the Duke d’Enghein, if he had killed all the
Bourbons for the good of France, I should say nothing
to that; but he had not much feeling. Whenever he
laments anybody, it is always for his own sake that
he does it. I don’t understand, either, a great man
making complaints about the room he slept in not
being good enough for him, or complaining of his
champagne: I dare say he had slept in many a worse.
Had I been in his place, you would have seen how
differently I should have acted, and that such a man
as Sir Hudson Lowe should never have seen that he
could have the power of vexing me. He was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
what I call a man of genius: a man of considerable
talent he certainly was. A man of genius is like a
fine diamond: what I understand by a fine diamond
is one resembling a large drop of water—smooth and
even on every side, so that, whichever way you look at
it, there is a blaze of light that seems as if it would
spread as you gaze on it. However, men of genius
have seldom a look that would tell you they are so;
for what a heavy-looking man Mr. Fox was! did
you ever see him? Mr. Pitt, again, had nothing
remarkable in his appearance; Mr. Pitt’s was not a
face that gave one the idea of a clever man. As he
walked through the park, you would have taken him
for a poet, or some such person, thin, tall, and rather
awkward; looking upwards as if his ideas were <i lang="fr">en air</i>,
and not remarking what was passing around him:
there was no expression in him at such a moment. It
was my grandfather who had the fine look. The best
picture of him is that at Chevening: he is represented
in his robes. The colour and fire in his eyes altogether
is very fine. Georgio pleased me, when (on his return
from England) he said, ‘Your face, my lady, is just
like your grandpapa’s:’ for the forehead, and the
upper part of the nose, and the contour of the countenance,
I know are the same.”</p>

<p>As I read on about Mr. Fox’s illness and death,
Lady Hester lay absorbed in her reflections almost as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
if in a trance. Her pipe fell from her hands, and the
bowl of it, turning downwards, emptied its lighted
contents on the blanket of her bed. I had not
observed this at first, until the smell of burning
made me look up, and I rose to knock off the
tobacco on the floor. A great round hole had been
burnt; but this was a common occurrence, and she
never or seldom noticed such accidents: my rising,
however, disturbed her from her reverie, and she spoke
as follows:—<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
“Mr. Fox, after Mr. Pitt’s death, sent two distinct
messages to me, offering me the means of securing
an independence for life. One was by Mr. Ward,
who said plainly to me—‘You know, Lady Hester,
you can never live, with your present income, as you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
have been accustomed to live; and, therefore, take
my advice, and accept Mr. Fox’s civility.’ I told him
that it was not from a personal disregard for Mr. Fox
that I refused; because, when I asked Mr. Pitt, upon
one occasion, who was the cleverest man in England,
he answered, ‘Mr. Fox:’ but, as the world only knew
Mr. Pitt and Mr. Fox as opposed to each other, I
should be considered as receiving benefits from Mr.
Pitt’s enemy. ‘You will live to repent your refusal,’
said Mr. Ward. I answered him that might be, but
if he talked for a year, he never would alter my
resolution.”</p>

<p>Lady Hester went on:—“Mr. Fox’s offer, doctor,
was as good as ten thousand pounds a year to me.
He was to make me ranger of some park, with a house;
and then I was to have a house in town, and the rest
was to be done in the way they shuffle those things
through the public offices.</p>

<p>“By the other, I was offered apartments in” (I
think she said) “Windsor Castle: but then, you
know, I must have been a courtier; and I rather
chose to live independent, on account of my two brothers.
And why did I take that house in Mountague
Square” (she always called it Mountague Square),
“but on their account! When I furnished it, I had
got some things which I had saved up, and which
were of no use in Downing Street: these I made use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
of now; but there were people so mean as to come
and spy about me, and to form unfair conjectures as
to how I got them. —— was one, who even went
to a large shop, and, from a kind of pencil drawing
which he had made, inquired how much such a lamp
as he had seen at my house would cost. They told
him seventy-five guineas. This lamp had been given
me by the Princess of Wales; but I never satisfied
their malignity by telling them: I let them talk on.
And, doctor, furnishing my house was no trifling
expense to me. But I thought it best that my brothers
should have somewhere to invite their friends
to when in town; and I fitted up two bed-rooms and
two breakfast-rooms for them with every luxury they
could have. Neither were they furnished in a common
way; for there were their libraries to each, and
everything customary in fashionable life. Why,
James used to have quite a levée; and breakfast was
always on table from nine to twelve, with tea and
coffee, and chicken, and tongue, and cold meat, and
all that. Nash often used to say to me, ‘Lord, my
lady, it is a great pity to make all this waste: I am
sure many of those officers make their dinner off
the colonel’s late breakfasts.’ But I used to answer,
‘Never mind;’ because I thought some of those men,
although they were people I could not know, might
be useful to him. He might want a second, or there
might be some other case, where one of these persons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
might be sent when another could not, and so on.
I do not say I could not know them, from pride; but
it would have been very awkward for me to have had
a red-faced captain coming up to me with, ‘My dear
Lady Hester, how do you do?’ Why, I recollect a
very respectable gentleman coming once
into a box at the Opera, where I was seated with
some duchess and some great folks, I forget who, and
claiming acquaintance with me. I very civilly answered
him with, ‘I hope you are well, Mr. T——,
how are all your friends in Cheshire?’ But, doctor,
to hear the tittering and the whispers of—‘Who is
your dear friend, Lady Hester?—really, the cut of
his breeches is particularly excellent!’ and another,
in a simpering voice, asking, ‘What on earth did the
man wear so many watches for?’ and then some one
crying, ‘Oh! they are the buttons of his coat;’ and
then a laugh, so that even I could hardly stand it.</p>

<p>“So, doctor, what I did for James and Charles was
to let them have a place to see their acquaintances;
and I every now and then gave a dinner, to keep together
for them a certain number of Mr. Pitt’s particular
friends. And then, in the summer, I would go
down to some retired spot in Wales, or somewhere,
where I saved as much as I could.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
“But,” she continued, “would you believe it? all
the time I kept house in Mountague Square, not one
of these people, not one of my relations, ever sent me
a single thing to help me on. Ah! now and then a
sea-captain would offer me a pipe of wine: but I always
put him civilly off with a ‘Not now, but when
you return from India,’ or some such answer. And,
from that time to this, these same relations would, I
believe, have let me starve, for aught they cared.</p>

<p>“You often wonder why I scold and scold, and
try to make you bring up your children to be useful
to themselves and others, and neglect all frivolous and
empty appearances: but the reason is that the world
is so heartless, that if you came to want a shilling,
you would not find a friend to give you one. If I,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
who had thousands of friends and acquaintances, have
been left to linger here, deserted and neglected, what
would be the lot of a common person? Has any one
of my relations, any one of my friends, any one of
those whom Mr. Pitt, and perhaps I, enriched, come
forward to help me?—not one.</p>

<p>“I have had a hard time for five-and-twenty years;
but you will never see me now in some of those convulsions
about it I once used to have: for, thank
God, my spirits are as good, when my cough leaves
me quiet, as ever they were. And what is the use of
trusting in man? No; my reliance is in God; and,
if it is his will to get me out of my difficulties, he will
do it in spite of them all. My only trouble is sometimes
about my debts: but I think all will be paid,
and from England too. So here I am, and we will
now talk of something else: but I must first tell you
a little Eastern story.</p>

<p>“There was a man who lived in affluence at Damascus,
surrounded by a happy and prosperous family,
when some reverses in business ruined his fortune,
and he was reduced to the necessity of exerting his
talents and industry in order to try to maintain his
station in life. As he wanted neither, he flattered
himself that, from his numerous connexions, he
should soon re-establish his affairs: but a fatality
seemed to hang over him; for, just as he was about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
to begin business again, the plague broke out in
the city, and his wife and daughters were among the
victims.</p>

<p>“Unable to bear the sight of a place where such
afflictions had overtaken him, he removed to Beyrout,
a seaport of some consequence even at that time, although
much more so now, and there, with his son
and a faithful servant, he opened a small shop, stocked
with such wares as he could procure without much
advance of capital. But here again he was unsuccessful;
for, his son becoming answerable for the
debts of a man who had befriended him, and being
unable to pay, his father’s little all was disposed of to
save him from prison, and by degrees beggary overtook
them. He then engaged himself as clerk to a
merchant, next turned schoolmaster, until his sight
failing him, he at last became stone-blind, and, in
despair, he resolved to quit a country, where, in spite
of his exertions, his position every day had grown
worse and worse.</p>

<p>“Accordingly, he embarked with his son for Damietta
in a vessel where there were fourteen passengers
besides himself, and among them two divers, people
who get a living on these coasts by diving for sponges,
which they bring up from the bottom of the sea. It
was the winter season, and the weather proved tempestuous.
In crossing the bar of Damietta, where the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
current of the Nile, opposed to the waves of the sea,
often makes a dangerous surf, the vessel foundered,
and every soul perished, except the old man, who,
when the others took to the boat, being blind, was unable
to shift for himself, and clung to the wreck, from
which he was removed the day afterwards.</p>

<p>“Struck with the singular decrees of Providence,
that an old blind man should have escaped the dangers
of the sea where even divers were drowned, he piously
raised his eyes to Heaven and said, ‘I see where my
fault has been: I have relied on my own exertions
and the help of man, when I should have trusted in
God alone. Henceforth I will put my faith in him,
and nobody else.’ His peculiar case became known
among the merchants of Damietta, and a subscription
was made for him; so that, in a few days, he had more
money at his disposal than all his friends, and all his
exertions, when he looked to them alone, had ever
procured for him. His serenity of mind returned: a
small but sufficient subsistence was secured to him;
and he spent the remainder of his days in pious gratitude
to the Almighty, whose wholesome chastisements
had brought him to a proper sense of the futility of
human plans, unless we confide in his goodness to
second our endeavours.”</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="label">[19]</a> “Lord Wellesley returned from his glorious administration
at a very critical period in our parliamentary history.
Mr. Pitt was stricken with the malady which proved fatal—a
typhus fever, caught from some accidental infection, when his
system was reduced by the stomach complaints he long laboured
under. He soon appointed a time when his friend might
come to see him. This, their last interview, was in the villa
on Putney Heath, where he died a few days after. Lord
Wellesley called upon me there many years after: it was then
occupied by my brother-in-law, Mr. Eden, whom I was visiting.
His lordship showed me the place where those illustrious
friends sat. Mr. Pitt was, he said, much emaciated and enfeebled,
but retained his gaiety and his constitutionally sanguine
disposition; he expressed his confident hopes of recovery. In
the adjoining room he lay a corpse the ensuing week; and it is
a singular and melancholy circumstance, resembling the stories
told of William the Conqueror’s deserted state at his decease,
that, some one in the neighbourhood having sent a message to
inquire after Mr. Pitt’s state, he found the wicket open, then
the door of the house, and, nobody answering the bell, he
walked through the rooms till he reached the bed on which the
minister’s body lay lifeless, the sole tenant of the mansion of
which the doors, a few hours before, were darkened by crowds
of suitors alike obsequious and importunate, the vultures
whose instinct haunts the carcases only of living ministers.”—<cite>Lord
Brougham’s Historical Sketches.</cite></p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="label">[20]</a> Lord Malmesbury cites Lady M.’s account of Mr. Pitt’s
last words as follows:—“Lady M. who saw Sir Walter Farquhar
three days after Pitt’s death, and received from him an
account of his last hours, said that almost the last words he
spoke intelligibly were these to himself, and more than once
repeated, ‘Oh! what times! oh, my country!’”</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="label">[21]</a> Here must be some mistake in my notes; for Lady Cobham’s
might have been a family picture, if the term were
applied to Lord Chatham’s residence; but how could it be so,
as belonging to the Wiltshire estate? However, I let it stand
as it was written at the time.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="label">[22]</a> Much has been written in prose and verse on the advantages
and mischief of smoking tobacco. Tissot, among others,
filled a volume to prove that half the maladies of mankind
may be traced to the use of tobacco. But when some millions
of people, male and female, as in Turkey, smoke from morning
till night, and live, florid and robust, to a good old age, it may
be questioned whether Tissot showed the same sagacity in his
nosological researches on this as on other subjects. All I can
say is that Lady Hester gave her sanction to the practice by
the habitual use of the long oriental pipe, which use dated
from the year 1817, or thereabouts.</p>

<p class="footnote">As she had now kept her bed for many weeks, we will
describe her there, when, lying with her pipe in her mouth,
talking on politics, philosophy, morality, religion, or on any
other theme, with her accustomed eloquence, and closing her
periods with a whiff that would have made the Duchess of
Rutland stare with astonishment, could she have risen from
her tomb to have seen her quondam friend, the brilliant ornament
of a London drawing-room, clouded in fumes so that her
features were sometimes invisible. Now, this altered individual
had not a covering to her bed that was not burnt into twenty
holes by the sparks and ashes that had fallen from her pipe;
and, had not these coverings been all woollen, it is certain that,
on some unlucky night, she must have been consumed, bed
and all.</p>

<p class="footnote">Her bed-room, at the end of every twenty-four hours, was
strewed with tobacco and ashes, to be swept away and again
strewed as before; and it was always strongly impregnated
with the fumes.</p>

<p class="footnote">The finest tobacco the country could produce, and the
cleanest pipes (for she had a new one almost as often as a fop
puts on new gloves), could hardly satisfy her fastidiousness;
and I have known her footman get as many scoldings as there
were days in the week on that score. From curiosity, I once
counted a bundle of pipes, thrown by after a day or two’s use,
any one of which would have fetched five or ten shillings in
London, and there were one hundred and two. The woods
she most preferred were jessamine, rose, and cork. She never
smoked cherry-wood pipes, from their weight, and because she
liked cheaper ones, which she could renew oftener. She never
arrived at that perfectability, which is seen in many smokers,
of swallowing the fumes, or of making them pass out at her
nostrils. The pipe was to her what a fan was or is in a lady’s
hand—a means of having something to do. She forgot it
when she had a letter to write, or any serious occupation. It
is not so with the studious and literary man, who fancies it
helps reflection or promotes inspiration.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="label">[23]</a> About the time of the Duke of York’s affair with Mrs.
Clarke, Lady Hester went into Wales, and, in an inn at Builth,
she got round her the exciseman, the apothecary, the landlord,
and some of the village farmers. “Pray, Mr. Innkeeper,” she
said, “how should you like a painted wife, with half-a-dozen
fine gentlemen about her, shaking the hair-powder on her
face? Or is it agreeable, Mr. M., to have the window opened
at dinner-time, in a cold November day, to let out the smells
of a parcel of dogs? I suppose, if you had an uncomfortable
home, you would think yourself at liberty to take a little
pleasure elsewhere.” With speeches of that sort she won them
all over to the duke’s side. To hear her relate the story herself,
with her mimickry of the men and the landlady, to each
of whom she addressed some question, which brought the case
home to their own feelings, was infinitely amusing: it was one
of the best scenes I ever heard her act.</p>

<p class="p2">Tuesday, May 15.—I had been to Sayda to-day,
and was within a mile of Jôon, on my return, when I
saw a servant making towards me in breathless haste.
A letter had arrived for me from Beyrout, which
Lady Hester had immediately forwarded to me on
the road by this man, charging him to deliver it with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
all possible speed, so that it should reach me before
the close of daylight. The reason of all this extraordinary
haste was that I might be enabled to communicate
at once with her, if necessary, concerning its
contents; as the vigil of Wednesday commenced at
sunset on Tuesday, from which hour till the following
sunset she could neither see me, nor admit of any
message from me. The reader will remember that on
every Wednesday, from sunset to sunset, her ladyship
was invisible.</p>

<p>There was indeed occasion, as it happened, for all
this haste. The letter was from Mr. K., an English
merchant at Beyrout, informing me of the alarming
illness of his wife, and begging, in the most pressing
terms, that I would use all expedition to come (as
he was pleased to express himself) and save her.</p>

<p>As the sun was now setting, I desired the servant
to tell Lady Hester that there would not be time in
the interval for me to see her, and that I should be
obliged to set off that night to Beyrout. I made my
arrangements accordingly, and started at three o’clock
in the morning, about two hours before daylight, accompanied
by a servant. The horses were all at
grass some miles from the house, so that I was compelled
to perform the journey on an ass. It took me eleven
hours; and, on my arrival, I found that Mrs. K. had
died in the morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
There was a very decent inn at Beyrout, kept by
one Guiseppe Paraschivà, a Greek, who gave the most
copious repasts that a hungry traveller can desire to
find. Having ordered my dinner, I went to the
French consul’s house, thinking there to meet with
the physician who attended Mrs. K. In the quadrangle
of his residence I saw a number of persons
assembled, and an auction going on. I had not made
three steps towards the circle, when a gentleman who
knew me advanced in a hurried manner towards me.
“Touch nobody,” said he; “the plague is in the
town: it has taken us by surprise; three persons
have died to-day in the blacksmiths’ street.”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> I
thanked my friend, and, having seen Monsieur Guys,
who confirmed the bad news of the plague and of
Mrs. K.’s death, I hastened away, and went to the
English consul’s, Mr. Moore. He was already in
quarantine, and received me at the doorway of his
house, where it happened Lord Prudhoe was then
sitting, in the same predicament.</p>

<p>The funeral of Mrs. K. took place in the evening.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
Her case had been a melancholy one: her sufferings
must have been excruciating; and the affection of the
husband, anxious to save the life of a wife he loved to
distraction, induced him to allow of certain unskilful
efforts for her relief, no doubt well intended, but assuredly
baneful to the patient. The lady was a German,
a model of domestic purity and affection, and idolized
by her husband.</p>

<p>I saw Mr. K. the following day, and condoled with
him on his loss. He was like a distracted man, and
lay prostrate on his sofa, vowing vengeance against
the French doctor, whom he denounced as his wife’s
murderer.</p>

<p>Saturday, May 19.—As the Franks had now begun
to shut up their houses, and the report of fresh cases
of plague had created some consternation, I returned
to Jôon. The preceding evening, whilst paying a
visit to Monsieur and Madame Guys, he put into my
hands a file of newspapers, a packet of letters, and a
parcel, just arrived by a French merchant-vessel from
Marseilles. The parcel contained Mr. George Robinson’s
“Three Years’ Residence in the East,” which
the author himself had kindly forwarded to me from
Paris. I had the pleasure of opening it at the thirty-sixth
page of his volume on Syria, and of reading to
my friends, Monsieur and Madame Guys, the well-deserved
tribute paid to their hospitality and distinguished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
merits, which excited in them a lively
emotion. “We do our best,” said Monsieur Guys,
“to make Beyrout agreeable to such travellers as we
are fortunate enough to become acquainted with; but
it is not always that we meet with such grateful
acknowledgments.” Mr. Robinson, in his Arab dress,
was the exact similitude of Burckhardt, alias Shaykh
Ibrahim. He also spoke Arabic with a degree of
fluency that made it probable, had he spent as many
years in the East as Mr. Burckhardt, he would have
been able, like him, almost to have passed for a
native.</p>

<p>Being long familiar with the road from Beyrout to
Sayda, it would be difficult for me to conjure up such
a picture of its rocky and solitary horrors as that
which has been drawn by M. Lamartine. Features
so romantic could have been portrayed only under
the sudden inspiration of novelty and surprise. First
impressions are strongly contrasted with the hackneyed
indifference of one who has traversed the same ground
over and over again, and is become familiar with its
peculiarities. Instead, therefore, of describing what
would strike the eye of the new-comer, let us substitute
a sketch or two of the actual manners of the
people in the khans or on the high road, as they are
presented to the habitual observer.</p>

<p>I left Beyrout on my return as soon as the city<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
gates were open, which was before sunrise. The mulberry
grounds and olive groves through which the
road lies extend in this direction for four or five miles.
Then the sandy soil ceases, the spurs of Mount Lebanon
come down to within a few hundred yards of the
seashore, and sometimes meet the waves. I was overtaken
hereabout by three horsemen, all Christians—for
Christians and Turks are seldom seen riding in
company—and one of this goodly trio was, thus early
in the morning, singing with all the force of his lungs.
Osman Chaôosh, who was with me, said, “That man,
who is so merry, is reputed to have the best voice in
all Sayda; he goes very often into the Mountain to
the different Emirs’ palaces, where he remains a fortnight
together, and diverts them by his songs. They
say the princes are so fond of him that he sometimes
brings away bags full of money. Then he is invited
to weddings, and to merchants’ and agas’ parties, and
wherever gaiety or amusement of any kind is going
forward.” By this time they had come up with us,
and were questioning Osman, in a low voice, where I
had been, &amp;c. They then kissed their hands, touched
their turbans, and, passing a-head, being well mounted
on good mares, they soon outstripped us, and left us
behind. Osman resumed the conversation—“Did
you observe that rider, with a full face, on the chestnut
mare, with a saddle covered with brocade? well, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
is one of the best penmen we have in all the pashalik.
He was a government secretary at Acre, and vast
sums of money passed through his hands; but some
stuck to his fingers, and, being found out, he was bastinadoed
and sent by the Pasha to the <i>Lemàn</i>,” (place
for convicts) “where he remained some months. He
was not badly off, however, as he did nothing except
smoking his pipe all day. He has now been out a
good bit, but is employed again.”—“And is he well
received in society after such an exposure?” I asked.—“Why
not?” replied Osman; “he was not quite
clever enough, and he suffered for it—that’s all.”</p>

<p>We soon after came to a khan, called El Khaldy,
where we found the three horsemen dismounted, and
seated under the shed, drinking arrack and smoking.
I made a halt likewise to get something for breakfast.
The khankeeper spread a clean mat on the floor of the
estrade, and on this I sat down. A brown earthenware
dish of <i>leben</i>, or curdled milk, was served up with a
wooden spoon, and about half a dozen bread-cakes, in
size and substance like pancakes, were placed before
me. When I had eaten this, a pipe and a finjàn of
coffee, with a lump of sugar out of a little provision
which Osman had in his saddle-bags (a precaution necessary
in these public-houses, where no such luxury
is found), finished my temperate meal. The ex-convict
and the singer were treated as great gentry, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
I could easily observe by the attention the master
paid them. Whilst I was smoking my pipe, another
horseman arrived with a groom on foot. The groom
tied up the horse in front of the khan, took off the
saddle-bags, and, from a napkin, which he spread on
the mat where his master had been littered down like
myself, he pulled out bread, cheese, and a paper of
<i>halâwy</i> or <i>nougat</i>, as the French call it. Then,
having unstrapped the nosebag of corn, he tied it over
the horse’s head, and came and seated himself opposite
his master, and both began to eat with sharp appetites,
master and servant without any distinction. The
landlord brought a small bottle with a spout to it, full
of arrack, and a tumbler, which were set down without
a word being spoken, showing he was well acquainted
with his guests’ taste. The gentleman—as persons
always do in the East—invited me to join him; and,
on my thanking him, he did the same to a poor peasant
who was seated near us. Good breeding among
them requires that, when they eat, they should ask
those present to do the same; but nobody ever thinks
of accepting the invitation, unless pressed upon him in
a manner which is understood to preclude a refusal.
I however accepted a bit of halâwy, not to appear uncivil,
upon which the traveller asked me if we had any
such sweetmeat in my country. I declared we had
none more to my taste, although our confectioners’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
shops possessed a great variety. He remarked that it
was an excellent thing on the road wherewith to stay
the appetite, and assured me that Haroun el Raschid
himself, if I had ever heard of that caliph, did not disdain
it. “Oh!” replied I, “we have many stories of
the Caliph Haroun.”—“Have you?” cried he: “then,
if you will give me leave, I will add one more to your
store.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>“Hakem was one of the familiar friends of the
Commander of the Faithful, Haroun el Raschid. The
caliph said to him one day, ‘Hakem, I mean to hunt
to-morrow, thou must go with me.’—‘Most willingly,’
answered Hakem. He went home and said to his
wife, ‘The caliph has ordered me to go a hunting
with him to-morrow, but really I cannot; I am accustomed
to dine early, and the caliph never takes his
dinner before noon: I shall die of hunger. Faith, I will
not go.’—‘God forbid!’ said the wife: ‘you do not
mean to say you will disobey the caliph’s order?’—‘But
what am I to do?’ said Hakem; ‘must I die of hunger?’—‘No,’
quoth the wife; ‘you have nothing to do but
to buy a paper of halâwy, which you can put in the
folds of your turban, and so eat a bit every now and
then whilst you are waiting for the caliph’s dinner
time, and then you will dine with him.’—‘Upon my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
word,’ said Hakem, ‘that’s an excellent idea.’ The
next day Hakem bought a paper of halâwy, stuck it
into his turban, and went to join the caliph. As they
were riding along, Haroun turned round, and looking
at Hakem, spied out in the folds of his turban, rolled
round his head, the paper in which the halâwy was
wrapped. He called to his Vizir Giaffer. ‘What is
your pleasure, Commander of the Faithful?’ said the
Vizir.—‘Do you see,’ said the caliph, ‘the paper of
halâwy that Hakem has stuck in his turban? By the
Prophet, I’ll have some fun with him: he shall not eat
a bit of it.’ They went on for a while talking, until
the caliph, pretending that he saw some game, spurred
on his mule as if to pursue it. Hakem raised his hand
up to his turban, took a bit of halâwy out of it,
and put it into his mouth. The same moment, the
caliph, turning back to him, cried out, ‘Hakem!’
Hakem spit out the halâwy, and replied:—‘Please
your Highness!’—‘The mule,’ said Haroun, ‘goes
very badly; I can’t think what is the matter with
her.’—‘I dare say the groom has fed her too
much,’ replied Hakem submissively; ‘her guts are
grumbling.’ They went on again, and the caliph
again took the lead. Hakem thought the opportunity
favourable, took out another bit of halâwy, and
whipped it slily into his mouth, when Haroun suddenly
turned round, crying ‘Hakem! Hakem!’—‘What
is your Highness’s will?’ said Hakem, again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
dropping the halâwy. ‘I tell you,’ rejoined the
caliph, ‘that this mule is a vile beast: I wonder
what the devil it is that troubles her!’—‘Commander
of the Faithful,’ said Hakem, ‘to-morrow the farrier
shall look at her, and see what ails her. I dare say it
is nothing.’ A few moments elapsed, and Hakem
said to himself, ‘Am I a farrier, that that fool should
bore me with his questions every moment? mule!
mule! I wish to God the mule’s four feet were in the
master’s belly!’</p>

<p>“Shortly after, the caliph pushed forward again.
Hakem cautiously carried his hand to the halâwy, and
made another trial; but, before he had time to put it
into his mouth, the caliph rode up to him, crying
out, ‘Hakem! Hakem! Hakem!’—‘Oh Lord,’ said
Hakem, ‘what a wretched day for me! nothing but
Hakem, Hakem! What folly is this!’—‘I think
the farrier must have pricked the mule’s foot,’ said
Haroun: ‘don’t you see that she is lame?’—‘My
lord,’ said Hakem, ‘to-morrow we will take her shoe
off; the farrier shall give her another shoe, and,
please God, we shall cure her.’</p>

<p>“Just then a caravan came along the road on its way
from Persia. One of the merchants approached the
caliph, prostrated himself before him, and presented
him with several objects of value, as also with a young
slave of incomparable beauty and of a lovely figure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
remarkable for the charms of her person, with taper
waist and swelling hips, eyes like an antelope’s, and
a mouth like Solomon’s seal. She had cost the merchant
a hundred thousand denàrs. When Haroun saw
her, he was charmed at her aspect, and became at once
passionately enamoured of her. He immediately gave
orders to turn back to Bagdad, and said to Hakem,
‘Take that young creature with you, and make haste
with her to the city. Get down at the palace—go up
to the Pavilion—put it in order—uncover the furniture,
set out the table—fill the bottles—and look that
nothing is wanting.’ Hakem hastened on, and executed
his commission. The caliph soon after arrived,
surrounded by his <i lang="fr">cortège</i> of vizirs, emirs, and courtiers.
He entered the Pavilion, and dismissed his suite.
Going into the saloon, where the young slave awaited
him, he said to Hakem, ‘Remain outside the door of
the saloon; stir not a single step from it; and see that
the Princess Zobëide does not surprise us.’—‘I understand,’
said Hakem. ‘A thousand times obedience to the
orders of God and to the Commander of the Faithful.’</p>

<p>“The caliph sat down to table with the young
slave: they ate, and then went into another room,
where wines and dessert were prepared. Haroun had
just taken a seat, had filled his glass, and had got it
to his mouth, when there was a knock at the door.
‘As sure as fate,’ said the caliph, ‘here is the Princess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
Zobëide.’ He rose in a hurry, put away the wine and
everything that was on the table, hid the young lady
in a closet, and opened the door of the pavilion, where
he finds Hakem. ‘Is the Princess Zobëide coming?’
said he to him. ‘No, my lord,’ said Hakem: ‘but I
fancied you might be uneasy about your mule. I have
questioned the groom, and, true enough, he had overfed
her: the beast’s stomach was crammed. To-morrow
we will have her bled, and all will be right again.’—‘Don’t
trouble thyself about the mule,’ said the caliph;
‘I want none of thy impertinent stories now. Remain
at thy post, and, if thou hearest the Princess Zobëide
coming, let me know.’—‘Your highness shall be obeyed,’
replied Hakem.</p>

<p>“Haroun re-entered the apartment, fetched the
beautiful slave out of the closet, and placed everything
on the table as before. He had hardly done, when
another knock was heard. ‘A curse on it! there is Zobëide,’
cries the caliph. He hides the slave in the
closet, shuffles off the wine and dessert, and runs to
the door. There he sees Hakem. ‘Well,’ says he,
‘what did you knock for?’—‘Indeed, Commander of
the Faithful,’ replied Hakem, ‘I can’t help thinking
about that mule. I have again interrogated the farrier,
and he pretends there is nothing the matter with
her, but that she has stood too long without work in
the stable, and that’s the reason why she was a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
lazy when you rode her to-day: otherwise she is very
well?—‘To the devil with ye both—thee and the
mule!’ said Haroun; ‘didn’t I tell thee I would have
none of thy impertinence? Stand where I told thee
to remain, and take care that Zobëide does not catch
us; for, if she did, this day would be a bad one for
thee.’—‘May my head answer for my vigilance,’ said
Hakem.</p>

<p>“Again the caliph goes in, and a third time lets
out the young slave, replenishes the table, fills a
goblet with wine, and carries it to his lips. Suddenly
he hears a clatter on the terrace: ‘This time,’ said
he, ‘there is Zobëide, sure enough.’ He pushes the
slave into her hiding-place, removes the fruit and the
wine, and burns some pastils to drive away the smell.
He hastens up to the terrace of the pavilion, finds nobody
but Hakem there, and says to him ‘Was that Zobëide?—where
is she?—is she coming?’—‘No, no,
Commander of the Faithful,’ said Hakem; ‘the princess
is not here; but I saw the mule making a clatter
with her feet, just as I did myself, and I am really
quite uncomfortable about her; I was afraid she had
the colic, and I feel quite alarmed.’—‘I wish to God
thou may’st have the colic all thy life, cursed fool
that thou art! Out with thee, and let me never see
thy face again! If thou ever presumest to come into
my presence again, I will have thee hanged.’ Hakem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
went home and told his wife that the caliph had
dismissed him, and had forbidden him ever to show
his face at court again. He remained some time in
his house, until he thought that the caliph’s anger had
subsided. He then said to his wife, ‘Go to the palace,
kiss Zobëide’s hand; tell her that the caliph is angry
with me, and beg her to intercede with him for me.’
The wife fulfilled his commission. The Princess Zobëide
interceded for Hakem, and the caliph pardoned
him.”</p>

<p>My narrator, after receiving my thanks for his <a id="chg3"></a>entertaining
story, took his leave, mounted his horse, and
rode off. The conversation now became general, and
turned on the river Damôor, which empties itself into
the sea midway between Beyrout and Sayda, and often
swells, from the rains and the melting of the snows in
the mountain, so as to become exceedingly dangerous
to ford, as there is no bridge over it. “What a fool
the Jew was,” cried one, “to lose his life for a few
piasters! The guides offered to take him across for a
<i>khyréah</i>—four of them, two at the head and two at
the flanks of his mule; but he must needs haggle,
and would give no more than ten piasters; and, seeing
one of the Pasha’s estafettes get across safe, he fancied
he could do the same: but they know the ford as well
as the guides; for they traverse it daily. So the Jew
was carried off, and neither he nor his mule were ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
seen afterwards.”—“It was just the same,” said a
second speaker, “with the peasant from Medjdeloony
who was going to buy wheat at Beyrout: for you
know, gentlemen, a Greek vessel had arrived from
Tarsûs with very good corn, at four and a half piasters
the <i>roop</i>. Well, he too was rash enough to suppose
he could get across alone, and they only asked him five
piasters—only a fourth of what they wanted of the
Jew. But the waters were up to his armpits; and,
his foot slipping just in the deepest part, he fell, and,
after a few struggles, was carried out to sea. All the
peasants of the village, which, you know, is close by
where the English queen lives, came down to watch if
the body was cast ashore: for they say he had above
a thousand piasters in his girdle from different poor
families who had commissioned him to buy for them:
and the poor creatures were naturally anxious to
recover it.”</p>

<p>Having smoked my pipe, I mounted my ass, crossed
the Damôor in safety, and halted again at <i>Nebby
Yuness</i>, a santon’s, where there are two comfortable
rooms for travellers, attached to the shrine. Here I
smoked another pipe, heard a long string of compliments
and grateful expressions from the <i>imàm</i> (who
lived there to show the shrine to pilgrims), in return
for the donations which Lady Hester sent occasionally
to the shrine, and which he pocketed. I remounted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
struck off at <i>Rumelly</i> from the high road into the
mountain by a cross country path, and at about five
o’clock reached Jôon.</p>

<p><i>Khaldy</i>, of which mention was made above, is a
spot which has been too much neglected by travellers;
and it would be well if some one, who had leisure and
ability for such researches, would pass a day or two
there, to make an accurate examination, and to take
drawings of the numberless sarcophagi which lie about
on the ground, or are hewn in the solid rock. Many
of them have bas-reliefs on them; and, as such a mass
of tombs must necessarily imply the former vicinity of
some ancient city, diligent research might lead to the
discovery of historical antiquities in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>There is a day in the year, in the month of June
or July, I now forget which, when hundreds of Christians
resort to this spot from Beyrout, Sayda, and the
villages of Mount Lebanon, for the celebration of a
saint’s festival; and a part of the holiday consists in
washing themselves in the sea. The craniologist might
have a fine field for study in beholding a hundred bare
heads at the same time around him. I happened once
to ride through Khaldy on that very saint’s day, and
never was I so struck with anything as with the sight
of countless shaved heads, almost all having a conical
shape, quite unlike European heads. But, besides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
this, a stranger would see much merry-making, dancing,
drinking, and many mountain female dresses united
here, which he would have to seek for through twenty
districts at any other time. Monsieur Las Cases has
a painting of this spot, which may, or might once, be
seen at the <i>Gobelins</i> manufactory at Paris, of which
establishment he was director some years ago, or else
in Monsieur Denon’s collection. It is one of those
exaggerated fancy paintings which artists are never
pardonable for making, when they are intended to be
shown as faithful copies; because, like certain historical
novels, they lend a false colouring to facts and
realities. There are other untruths besides those which
are spoken or written; and these undoubtedly may be
classed amongst the most reprehensible. I often regretted
that my numerous occupations prevented me
from wandering over this interesting field of inquiry.</p>

<p>Sunday, May 20.—I gave Lady Hester an account
of the tragical end of poor Mrs. K., which induced
her to write a letter of consolation to the afflicted
widower, of whom, though she had never seen him,
she was a sincere well-wisher. This is a copy of it:—</p>


<p class="p2 center">
<i>To Mr. K., merchant at Beyrout.</i><br>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right r2">
Jôon, May 20, 1838.<br>
</p>

<p class="indent2">Sir,</p>

<p>Nearly a year ago I had commissioned <i>Mohadýn</i>—Mr.
Lancaster’s idle and talkative <i lang="fr">ci-devant</i> young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
servant—to felicitate you upon your marriage: but
now the task of administering consolation for the late
sad event devolves upon me. Mrs. K.’s conduct, from
the first, had made a strong impression upon my mind.
Young and handsome, as she was, to have left her
country to follow you, argued her to be of no common
mould. Avoiding to be detrimental to your interests,
and giving up the empty homage, which vanity would
have demanded with most women, that you should
have left your affairs to accompany her—above considering
what scandal might set afloat in the world—she
followed the dictates of her own heart, and relied
upon your honour: a circumstance, which, in the
annals of your life, ought not to be forgotten.</p>

<p>That you should be in despair at the loss of such a
woman is but too natural: but you should consider,
at the same time, that you have enjoyed perhaps in
this one year more happiness than falls to the share of
many, even during the course of their lives. Thank
God for it! and do not, by despondency, displease the
Omnipotent who has thus favoured you, or allow that
amiable creature in other regions, from which she is
perhaps still watching over you, to witness your
despair. I have heard from one who knows you that
you are of a manly character. Without making any
sacrifice of those feelings which belong to energetic
people only, make use of that energy and good sense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
to palliate your griefs; and bow with resignation to
the will of the Almighty. I am quite against persons
endeavouring to drive away sorrow by hurry or dissipation:
cool reflection can alone bring some balm to
the soul.</p>

<p class="right r2">
<span style="margin-right: 6em;">I remain, sir, &amp;c.</span><br>
<span class="smcap">Hester Lucy Stanhope</span>.<br>
</p>

<p>PS.—In the present state of your mind, I will not
allow you to give me any answer. But I shall keep
my eye upon you; and, if you are unheeding of my
advice, I shall put myself into one of my great passions,
which even exceed those which I understand
you sometimes fall into, but which enhance your
character in my estimation. For the cold-heartedness
of men of the present generation is nearly death
to me.</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb">

<p>After this letter was written, Lady Hester talked
about Lord Prudhoe and Colonel Davidson, who was
also staying at the inn at Beyrout, and whose father,
Lady Hester said, was a man of some note in her
time. “Did you make acquaintance with them?”
she asked: I replied, “No; for according to English
custom, Englishmen, even in lands so remote from
home, maintain their strange reserve, and carry their
looks of distrust with them wherever they go. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
‘Who are you, I wonder?—‘shall I degrade myself
in speaking to you?’ seems to be ever uppermost in
their thoughts.” She then spoke of Mrs. Moore, the
lady of the British consul, whom she eulogized greatly.
“That is one of the few women I must like,” said
Lady Hester; “indeed it is my duty to do so, and,
when next you go to Beyrout, you must tell her so:
but you don’t know the reason, nor does she. What
do you think of her, doctor?” I answered, “It appears
to me that M. Lamartine, had he known her, would
have felt the inspiration which he caught so readily in
the poetic land of the East:—he has celebrated beauty
less remarkable than hers.”</p>

<p>“And so I dare say you have supplied the omission,”
observed Lady Hester. “I have attempted to
do so in a very bungling way,” replied I. “Well,”
said she, “never mind; let me hear what you have
written.” So I drew out a few verses, which I had
pencilled at the inn at Beyrout immediately after
I had the honour of seeing that lady, and read
them.</p>

<p>“They are not so bad,” observed Lady Hester;
“but that was not what you went to Beyrout for.”</p>

<p>The subject carried her back to past times, and she
said—“I have made it a rule all my life, from the
moment I came into the great world, never to suffer
verses to be written about me by anybody. If I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
liked the thing, I might have had thousands of poets
to celebrate my praises in all manner of ways; but
there is nothing I think so ridiculous. Look at the
Duchess of Devonshire, with every day ‘A copy of
verses on her taking a walk’—‘An impromptu on her
having a headache’—and all such nonsense: I detest
it.”</p>

<p>This brought to my mind a circumstance which
occurred in the early part of our travels. I had
written a small poem, in which a few lines, eulogistic
of herself, were introduced; and one day I read it to
her. After I had finished, she said, “You know,
doctor, this will only do to show people in private;
and, if ever you dare to put my name to any published
poetry, I’ll take measures to make you heartily repent
of it.”</p>

<p>Lady Hester, however, was not insensible to that
species of praise which rests on the application of a
passage of some classic author, to illustrate one character
by its resemblance to that of another already
stamped with celebrity. Thus she was greatly pleased
when Mr. Pitt, in reading Gray’s fragment of the
tragedy of Agrippina aloud, and in coming to some
lines in which he recognized a great similarity to her
language, cried out—“Why, Hester, that’s you; here
you are—just like you!” then, reading on a little
farther—“Here you are again scolding him!” meaning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
as Lady Hester told me at the time, that it was
just like her, scolding Lord Mahon.</p>

<p>Tuesday, May 22.—I had struck a Turk, one of the
servants, with a stick over his shoulders; but, in so
doing, I forgot the penalty attached to striking a Mussulman.
Formerly such an act, done by a Christian
hand, was punished with death, or the alternative of
becoming a renegado of one’s faith. Even now the old
Mussulman servants muttered threats against me, as I
was told, and I really think would have done me harm,
if they could. For all Lady Hester’s power hardly
went farther than to have her people punished by the
instrumentality of another Turk; but the moment
I thought proper to chastise a fellow’s insolence with
my own hand, she did not hesitate to tell me that I
must be wary how I repeated it again; assuring me
that a blow from a Christian never could be pardoned by
them.</p>

<p>Thursday, May 24.—In reading the newspapers,
Lord Byron’s name occurred. “I think,” said Lady
Hester, “he was a strange character: his generosity
was for a motive, his avarice for a motive: one time
he was mopish, and nobody was to speak to him;
another, he was for being jocular with everybody.
Then he was a sort of Don Quixote fighting with the
police for a woman of the town; and then he wanted
to make himself something great. But when he allowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
himself to be bullied by the Albanians, it was all over
with him; you must not show any fear with them.
At Athens, I saw nothing in him but a well-bred man,
like many others: for, as for poetry, it is easy enough
to write verses; and as for the thoughts, who knows
where he got them? Many a one picks up some old
book that nobody knows anything about, and gets his
ideas out of it. He had a great deal of vice in his
looks—his eyes set close together, and a contracted
brow, so”—(imitating it). “Oh, Lord! I am sure
he was not a liberal man, whatever else he might be.
The only good thing about his looks was this part,”
(drawing her hand under the cheek down the front of
her neck), “and the curl on his forehead.”</p>

<p>Saturday, May 26.—About eleven at night, Lady
Hester went into the bath, previous to which I passed
two or three hours with her. The conversation ran on
the arrival of some Europeans at Sayda, who, by the
report of a servant returning from the town, had lost
two of their number by the plague, and, in consequence,
had been put into quarantine at Sheemaôony, the
Turkish mausoleum spoken of in a former page, about
a quarter of a mile from the city gate. Lady Hester
had heard of their distressed situation about four
o’clock in the afternoon, it being said they were pilgrims
who had applied for permission to be lodged at
Dayr el Mkhallas, the monastery at Jôon, which had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
been acceded to by the monks but forbidden by the
health officers, owing to a foul bill of health they
brought with them. Subsequently it was given out
that they were poor Germans; and she, with her accustomed
humanity, thinking they might be in want
of some little comforts, had made up a couple of
baskets of violet and rose syrups, capillaire, lemons,
&amp;c., and despatched a man with a note, in these
words:—“The humble offering of Lady Hester Stanhope
to the sick Germans, with her request that they
will make known their wants to her, whether for
medicines, or for whatever they may need.”</p>

<p>The servant had hardly set off, when an express
arrived with a letter to her ladyship from one of the
strangers, to the effect that, one of the party being ill,
the writer requested she would be kind enough to send
down her doctor. It was signed Charles Baron de
Busech, Knight of Malta. On asking me whether I
was afraid of the plague, I answered, “Yes; and as
it appeared they were men of rank, and could not fail
of obtaining medical advice from Sayda, where there
were four or five army surgeons, and two or three
physicians, I thought it best not to go until more
clear information had been obtained respecting them.”
Lady Hester approved of this, and wrote the following
reply:—</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
<i>To the Baron Charles de Busech, Knight of Malta, in<br>
    quarantine on the seashore, Sayda.</i><br>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right r2">
Jôon, May 26, 1838.<br>
</p>

<p class="indent2">Sir Baron,</p>

<p>Although I myself have no fear of the plague, or of
persons infected with it, almost all the Franks have.
The physician who is with me happens to be of the
number; therefore, it does not depend on me to cure
people of what I consider prejudices. Our days are
numbered, and everything is in the hands of God.</p>

<p>Your letter is without a date, and comes from I
know not where. At the moment that I received it I
had sent a servant with a few cooling syrups to some
sick Germans, guarded by a ring of soldiers outside of
the town, of whose names and class in life I am ignorant,
although the peasants give out that there are
some of very high quality among them: for I feared
that, in a strange country, and thus surrounded by
fever or perhaps plague, they would not be able to
procure the drinks necessary in such maladies. I hope
not to have offended any one, although I have made a
blundering business, not knowing who I addressed
myself to. But, having understood that they had
yesterday demanded an asylum at Dayr Mkhallas,
which had been refused them, I was uneasy on their
account.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
I have ordered my purveyor at Sayda, Captain
Hassan Logmagi, to come up to-morrow, that I may
get a right understanding in this confused affair, and
may see if it is in my power, by any trifling service,
to be useful to them. Allow me to remark that, if, in
any case, symptoms of plague, or even of the ardent
fevers of the country, manifest themselves, the Frank
doctors understand but little about it. The barbers
of the country are those who have the most knowledge
on the subject.</p>

<p>This letter goes by the servant, who has in charge
the basket of syrups, and whom I had called back
when about ten minutes on his road.</p>

<p class="right r2">
<span class="smcap">H. L. Stanhope.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The servant was despatched, and many conjectures
were formed as to who the Baron de Busech could be.
The reader will say that it mattered little who he was,
and that humanity dictated, when a sick person demanded
assistance, to go without delay and afford it.
This, in common cases, no doubt was what I or any
other medical practitioner should feel it his duty to
do; but, where Lady Hester was concerned, the ordinary
rules of life would not hold good. I at once
considered what a warfare would ensue between her
ladyship and myself on the treatment to be followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
(she always assuming the right of dictation); and I
thought it best to say I was afraid of the plague: for,
although I felt little difficulty in giving way to Lady
Hester’s opinion on other matters in discussion between
us of every possible kind, it was different where the
treatment of the sick was concerned; for there the
case became serious, and life and death were in the
balance.</p>

<p>Lady Hester made this, my refusal, a pretext for a
long lecture, which she delivered in a mild tone, but
mixed with the self-boasting common to her. Her
reasoning was indisputably sound, but she did not
know the motive that guided me.</p>

<p>Sunday, May 27.—Her ladyship’s letter to the
baron was taken to Logmagi at Sayda, who went immediately
and delivered it to that gentleman, and,
according to the orders sent to him, offered his services
and those of her ladyship to all the party. He
then came up to the Dar, and informed her that the
strangers were several in number, Germans of distinction,
and delivered a letter to her from one of
them. It was couched in courtly language, to thank
her for her attention to them. It repeated the request
that she would let her doctor come down, and
was signed Maximilian, Duke of Bavaria.</p>

<p>As Beyrout was closed, owing to the plague, and
the Sayda bakers never make any bread but flat cakes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
flaky and unpalateable, Lady Hester ordered, as a
first step for their comfort, a baking of forty or fifty
loaves, about the size of twopenny loaves: and this
supply was continued to the duke and his suite during
the whole time they remained. She sent tea and a
teapot, rum, brandy, and such little things as she
knew could not be procured in the town. These
articles were accompanied by a letter, as follows:—</p>

<p class="p2 center">
<i>To H.R.H. Duke Maximilian of Bavaria.</i><br>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right r2">
Jôon, May 27, 1838.<br>
</p>

<p class="indent2">Highness,</p>

<p>I have been but too much flattered by the goodness
with which you were pleased to look on the liberty I
have already taken: it is a proof of your greatness as
well as of your condescension. Dr. M. has made up
his mind to present himself to your highness; but
perhaps, on a first visit, he will not say what I will
presume to do.</p>

<p>In the first place, the air of the spot where chance
has put you is bad. There is danger of getting a
fever, unless you wrap yourself up well as the evening
closes in, and take, in going to bed, a little brandy
and water, with sugar in it, instead of cooling things:
but what is best of all is a little rum, to prevent the
circulation from becoming languid from the damp,
and to keep up perspiration. Medical books say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
nothing of this, nor, generally speaking, have doctors
much knowledge about it: but I have acquired my
information from people who have never been attacked
with fever, although often exposed, from their occupations,
to sun and fatigue. The Germans (who, according
to the traditions of the ancient Arabians, are of
exceeding high race), like the kings, their ancestors,
are not brought up idlers: therefore, it seems much
more reasonable to infer that, if they follow the practice
of the laborious, it will suit them better than the
system pursued by indolent beings, who lead a kind of
false existence, and whose complaints are often imaginary
or the consequence of their own prejudices. In
fevers of the country one cannot drink too much of
cooling things, or of cold water: for if, during one or
two days previous to trying any remedies intended to
excite the circulation, refreshing beverages are not
given, internal inflammation comes on, which carries
off a man in a few hours. Bleeding is almost never
to be feared in this country.</p>

<p>Pardon me for having thus made myself a doctor;
but it is necessary that your highness should have
some insight into what is most necessary to observe in
a climate which is a very wholesome one, if a person
knows how to accustom himself to it.</p>

<p class="right r2">
<span class="smcap">H. L. Stanhope.</span><br>
</p>
</div>


<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
The letter being sent off, I mounted, and rode down
with the view of presenting myself to the prince. I
have already described the Shemaôony, where he was
encamped, as a vaulted building covering the tombs
of some pashas of former days, and having an arcade
of about thirty feet square, where devout pilgrims,
who visited the tombs, might pray, eat, and sleep.
The sand of the seashore reaches to its base, and behind
is a lane running through gardens, overshadowed
with sycamores, eastern lilac trees, vines, banana
plants, orange-trees, &amp;c. The prince’s tents were
fixed some in front and some in rear of the building,
and the platform of the arcade was given up to the
servants. The quarantine guards had their tents in the
foreground, at a convenient distance, and sentries at
the four angles prescribed the bounds out of which the
travellers were not to stir, and within which nobody
from without was to intrude.</p>

<p>As soon as I alighted from my horse, Baron de
Busech made his appearance, and, advancing to the
boundary, told me the prince was gone with Khosrô
Effendi, the government secretary, and a file of soldiers,
to look at a villa not far off, where, if possible,
he might be somewhat better accommodated than in
the broiling spot they were then occupying. The
baron took the opportunity of the duke’s absence to
inform me of the state of his own health. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
suffering from an indisposition, light, indeed, but
alarming in his present situation. The history of the
party was as follows:—</p>

<p>The Duke of Bavaria, prince of the blood royal,
and brother-in-law to the reigning monarch, a young
man, in size and appearance something like the Duke
of Orleans, had left Europe for Egypt, had crossed
the desert to Syria, and had visited Jerusalem. The
plague was in the holy city; and on quitting it for
Nazareth, the duke’s physician, a German of six and
twenty, fell ill and died in two or three days, whilst
at the same time a negro, the duke’s Mameluke, was
attacked with symptoms similar to those that had
carried off the doctor. The duke and his suite quitted
Nazareth precipitately, and the monks of the monastery
there caused the effects of the deceased to be
burnt, considering his case one of plague. On reaching
Sayda, the party, having a foul bill of health,
were stopped, and put under quarantine. It consisted
of his Royal Highness Duke Maximilian; of Charles
Baron de Busech, and his brother, Baron Frederick;
of the Count Wilsensheim, one of his Imperial Majesty’s
chamberlains, and consul-general from his
Holiness the Pope at Ancona; of the Chevalier
Heusler; Captain Heugler of the Bavarian guards;
Mr. Meyer, painter; Mr. Petzmeyer, an accomplished
musician; with servants, to the number of fifteen or
sixteen persons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
In about half an hour the duke arrived, and with
great condescension conversed with me for some time.
He was much annoyed at the awkward situation in
which he found himself, expressed great obligations to
Lady Hester, and begged me to do what I could for
the baron’s complaint. The interview over, I remounted
my horse, and returned to Jôon, to send
down medicines, and to give Lady Hester an account
of my visit.</p>

<p>Tuesday, May 29.—I went down again. This time
I was called upon to decide whether the duke’s black
Mameluke had the plague or not. It may be conceived
what agitation the duke himself was in; for, if
the case was one of plague, in addition to the danger
he ran of being himself infected, he would be subjected,
perhaps, to a month’s quarantine. I had not
been able to see the black on my previous visit; for
he was in a tent behind the building; and, being too
weak to walk to where I was, none of the servants
were willing to lead him. A Turk, therefore, was
hired for a pecuniary compensation to attend on him,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
and he now led him, tottering and debilitated by sickness,
to the exterior of the tents, under some trees,
where a tent was fixed for him. There the poor fellow
could lie and inhale the breezes of that blue sea, over
which he never was to sail again; there he might have
the view of travellers passing and repassing, and, if his
thoughts were not disturbed by delirium, might find
some solace from the novelty of the scene.</p>

<p>As I had declared my inability, from the distance at
which I lived, to undertake the black’s cure, the duke
had engaged one of the regimental surgeons from Sayda.
The poor patient was conducted out, and with a
glistening eye, furred lips, and a total inattention to
objects around him, was half led and half supported to
the spot destined for him. He fell on his mattress,
and, after he had lain a minute or two, I spoke to him
in English. At the sound of his mother tongue, he
raised his head. It must be mentioned that his situation
had something peculiarly distressing in it. Born
in New York, a free black, he had at the age of fifteen
accompanied a Dutch merchant to Havre, Paris,
Antwerp, and Frankfort. There the duke, who one
day caught sight of him and was taken with his fine
countenance and person, offered him advantageous
terms to come and live with him; which, with the
consent of his first master, he did. The duke dressed
him as a Mameluke, and (from being as handsome a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
black as could be seen, even now in sickness) his good
disposition, coupled with his appearance, made him a
favourite. He accompanied his royal highness in his
travels. Having picked up a little German, all went
on very well so long as his health was good; but when
sickness overtook him, and his supposed malady made
him an object of terror to everybody, he had much
difficulty in explaining his wants. Judge, then, of the
electrical effect that the sound of English must have
had on him. He was called Wellington.</p>

<p>“Wellington,” said I, “how do you do? Take
courage, my good fellow; I am come to see if I can
be of any use to you.” He stared for some time before
he could recover himself, but at last he answered,
“Blessings on you then, sir, for I am much in want
of somebody to speak to. I am very ill, and nobody
can understand me. I want a clean shirt, and they
say I can’t have one washed: now, that I won’t believe;
and I wish you would tell somebody to send a
washerwoman to me.” I assured him that nobody
was to blame. I endeavoured to make him understand
how he was situated; and, after comforting
him awhile, told him I was desirous of examining his
swellings. I had never seen a plague-swelling but
once, and that twenty years before: so that my
evidence could only be negative proof of the nonexistence
of that disease. His attendant placed him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
in a favourable position, and, at the distance of five
feet from him, I inspected it as well I could: it was
as big, taking its outer border, as the back of a small
hand, and seemingly angular. There was much
stupor, into which he fell the moment I ceased to
speak to him. His skin was dry, his tongue black,
his head ran round if he raised it from the pillow; he
had great thirst, great debility, and no appetite. These
concomitant circumstances made it probable that the
swelling was pestilential; and the surgeon of the regiment,
who was with me, and who had seen many cases
of plague, was of that opinion.</p>

<p>When I returned to the duke, who was waiting for
me with the government secretary, and M. Lapi, the
Austrian referendary, I told them I must decline
saying it was not the plague. The duke was vexed;
for I believe at that moment he would have given half
his dukedom, and me a ribbon to my button-hole, to
be out of his unpleasant situation; but I composed his
mind as much as possible, by assuring him that, even
if it were plague, neither he nor his suite now ran any
risk of taking it: since, at such an advanced period of
the spring, experience had shown that the contagion,
under common precaution, was rarely propagated.
Still the duke betrayed great anxiety, by his eagerness
to obtain a positive denial from me of its being the
plague. “It is nothing but a syphilitic case—I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
sure you think so—do tell the quarantine inspector
so”—and many expressions of that sort fell from his
mouth; but I could not conscientiously speak otherwise
than I had done, as too much responsibility for
the safety of the community rested upon it.</p>

<p>I requested that a cabin of branches might be made
over Wellington’s tent, to keep the burning sun out;
and recommended such little comforts as his case
seemed to require. It was agreed that the medical
treatment should be the same as in malignant fever,
and I then returned to Jôon.</p>

<p>Wednesday, May 30.—I did not see Lady Hester
until after sunset. Poor Wellington’s situation excited
in her much sympathy, and the duke’s still more.
She treated my opinion lightly, and considered his
highness hardly dealt with. She wrote a letter to
that effect, and gave her own view of the subject,
which was certainly entitled to much consideration,
from her having the conviction that she had had the
plague herself many years before. Plague is generally
sporadic the first year of its appearance, little contagious,
and passes almost unobserved, under the
denomination of <i>humma</i>, or malignant fever: it is
in the second year that its ravages become terrible.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
Thursday, May 3.—Provisions were sent down to
the duke and his party, and Lady Hester was quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
busy in providing for, and anticipating their wants.
M. Lapi came up at her request, to give her some
information respecting the duke and his suite.</p>

<p>Friday, June 1.—This day a messenger came from
Beyrout with a file of newspapers up to April 15th.
In one of them (April 12th), appeared a paragraph
regarding Lady Hester’s affairs. M. Guys wrote me
word that he was still prevented from setting off to
Aleppo, owing to the plague. He informed me also
that Mr. K. was about to commence an action against
the French doctor, for unprofessional treatment in his
wife’s illness, which Mr. K. styled assassination.
This line of conduct did not accord with Lady Hester’s
notions of humanity and forbearance towards a practitioner
to whom less blame attached than if the case
had been left solely to his guidance. She accordingly
wrote to him the following letter, which, however, did
not go until the 3rd:—</p>


<p class="p2 center">
<i>To Mr. K., merchant, at Beyrout.</i><br>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right r2">
June 3rd, 1838.<br>
</p>

<p class="indent2">Sir,</p>

<p>If the interest I feel in your unhappiness gives me
any claims upon your attention, you must allow me to
make a few remarks on what I am sorry to hear is
about to take place—the bringing Monsieur G. to a
sort of trial respecting his unsuccessful treatment of
your poor wife. I shall speak of it under two heads:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
first, that of your being wanting in humanity and
generosity towards a young man coming into the
world, and, secondly, that of the great probability of
your being nonsuited, which will make you appear very
ridiculous, as well as be the means of bringing forward
many unpleasant and unusual circumstances, which
would excessively shock the delicacy of the English.</p>

<p>1. In Mr. Pitts last illness I expressed, as my
opinion, that Sir Walter Farquhar did not understand
the nature of his complaint, and begged him to
call in other physicians. He replied, “Perhaps you
are right, and such may be likewise my own opinion;
but, if it is the will of God, I shall recover; and, if
not, I shall be sorry that one of the last actions of my
life should be that of injuring the character of a man
who has acted to the best of his knowledge, and
hitherto manifested the greatest interest about my
health upon all occasions;”—therefore, nothing could
be done with him: but Farquhar was himself persuaded
to call in Doctor Bailey. Would it not be
better to follow the example of that noble-minded
man, than cast a slur upon the character of one who,
unprepared for so difficult an accouchement, had
neither sufficient self-confidence nor judgment to extricate
himself in such a predicament? And all this
will not recall Mrs. K—— again to the world.</p>

<p>2. I enclose a paragraph from the papers last come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
to hand, which, in addition to my knowledge of law,
strengthens my opinion that you may very likely
prove unsuccessful.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> You will then have to reproach
yourself for not having acted—I will not say with the
missionaries—with <em>Christian</em> charity, but with that
feeling which ought to belong, and does belong, to many
individuals, of whatever religion they may profess.</p>

<p>Do not understand by this that I am making you
any reproaches; for the state of irritation you are in
proceeds from the frame of mind which this unfortunate
circumstance has caused, and which it is the
duty of all those who call themselves your friends or
your well-wishers to point out to you, that you may
avoid future remorse when you see things more calmly.</p>

</div>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Saturday, June 2.—I rode down to the duke’s tents,
to see him. The army surgeon in attendance on the
black had reconsidered the case, and given in an
opinion to the government secretary that it was one
of typhus fever, supervening on a syphilitic taint, and,
in consequence, his highness’s quarantine had been
shortened to a fortnight. One must have lived in
Turkey to know how such things are conducted there.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
The conversation with the duke and his suite turned
for a while on Prince Pückler Muskau.</p>

<p>Sunday, June 3.—A letter was written by Lady
Hester to Lord Brougham. Whilst considering
what she should say, previous to dictating it, she
observed that she was sorry she did not write to him
before; “for,” added she, “he loves to have something
to talk about that will make a noise, and he will take
it ill, when he was so civil to me formerly, if I seem
to forget him. An Englishman, who was here, and
who knew him, one day said to me—‘What do you
think of Lord Brougham’s principles?’—‘Why,’ answered
I, ‘I think they are like mine—none at all.’
How he stared, doctor, until I added, ‘He has
peculiar ones made for himself, as I have.’”</p>


<p class="p2 center">
<i>To the Right Honourable Lord Brougham and Vaux.</i><br>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right r2">
Jôon, June 4th, 1838.<br>
</p>

<p class="indent2">My Lord,</p>

<p>It is possible that, at times, your lordship may bear
in mind the kindness with which you treated me, for
the sake of those whom we mutually loved and admired,
and the assistance you afforded me in my
private concerns, about seventeen years ago: you will
then, perhaps, not feel a little surprised that, having
got myself into a strange predicament, I have been
totally silent. It arose, my lord, from supposing you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
in ill health. Receiving no newspapers from England,
and news from France being oftentimes much retarded,
I often owe the chief of my political information to
travellers; among whom was the Prince Pückler
Muskau, who, having heard of my affair before he
saw me, advised me immediately to write to your
lordship. I gave him my reasons for not having done
so, and from him I received the assurance that you
were quite recovered, and again had resumed your
public duties. I have since read your most beautiful
speech on the slave-trade, and I congratulate the
country on your reappearance in the House.</p>

<p>Before this letter reaches you—for I have missed
the last packet—your lordship will have probably
heard of the manner in which her Majesty’s ministers
have thought proper to treat me, with her sanction.
I have always been the greatest of aristocrats; I was
born so; yet no one is more tenacious of the rights of
men in every class of life. I have written a very
severe letter to the Queen, in which I have made her
Majesty understand I am no longer an English subject:
for I had sooner be the subject of a Hottentot
chief than one to be commanded by a woman * * * *
* * * * * guided by a man who possesses none of
the qualities of his great patron, Mr. Fox, except his
<i lang="fr">talens pour la débauche</i>:—if he had, he would recollect
that nobleman’s conduct to me after Mr. Pitt’s death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
Although of a character violent to desperation, few
persons, I believe, have given more examples of forbearance
than I have done, both to those calling themselves
my friends and to those who rank among my
enemies, from these simple motives—either from my
personal contempt of them or their opinion, or from
the knowledge that they were acting upon a principle
which they thought a meritorious one. But when a
crowned head, or a minister, ventures to cast a slur
upon my integrity (which I hope may vie with that
which has ever distinguished my ancestors) without
any inquiries into either facts or motives, and pretends
to invest low venal people with any authority over me
or my concerns, I shall repel the aggression with the
energy it requires, and make every sacrifice which circumstances
may call for: and, should starvation stare
me in the face, it will not appal me. These are my
fixed determinations, and this is the sovereign contempt
I feel for * * * * * * and * * * * * *. As
things must have already taken some turn, I will not
request your lordship’s assistance: for I should not
forgive myself for either causing you trouble or
anxiety. I shall boldly follow my fate, as I always
hitherto have done.</p>

<p>These few lines, therefore, are only to be considered
as a mark of personal respect towards your lordship,
and as affording me an opportunity of expressing my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
congratulations for the restoration of your health;
which, however, I hope you will continue to <i lang="fr">ménager</i>,
as you will want a great store of it in the bad times
that are coming, and when the value of men of your
extraordinary talents and exertions will be properly
estimated.—I have the honour, my lord, to be, with
great truth and esteem, yours,</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Monday, June 4.—A letter from the Pasha’s wife
to Lady Hester took me down to Sayda to see the
Pasha’s little daughter, an angelic child of about seven
years of age, ill of a fever. The mother did not show
herself; Madame Lapi, the lady of the Austrian referendary,
and Madame Bertrand, a French lady,
receiving me. The Pasha was absent at the camp in
the Horàn. Sulyman Pasha, when appointed to the
pashalik of Sayda, had found no house fit for a residence,
and had caused a small, low palace to be built,
which, if placed in the midst of a paddock, might have
passed for a gentleman’s house of a thousand a year
in England. In the three rooms I went through, to
the one wherein the little girl was lying, there was,
as is usual in Turkish houses, the utmost simplicity:
but one thing struck me as indicative of the nationality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
of the master of the house<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>—a large French
looking-glass; for I believe a person would with difficulty
have found another mirror on the walls of a
saloon all through Syria, excepting in a Frank house.
The child was but slightly indisposed, and it is possible
that mere feminine curiosity had induced her mother to
send for me, that she might get a look through some
peep-hole to see whether she should like to consult
me for some complaint of her own: for such are the
indirect ways of proceeding common in harýms, and
such things had happened to me before. The Pasha’s
wife was originally a Greek slave, bought during the
horrors of the Greek revolution, when Turkish soldiers
sold their prisoners into bondage. She had
pleased him, and he eventually made her his wife.
Report spoke highly of her beauty and her conduct.</p>

<p>Tuesday, June 5.—Logmagi had been sent for to
rate the maids, who had been caught scaling the garden-wall
before sunrise and going down to the spring,
where they were seen with some one. As they never
were permitted to leave the house, or the inner court,
this violation of her ladyship’s orders, so contrary to
Eastern propriety, which allows not of a woman’s
being out of doors in the company of men, called for
some chastisement, more especially when coupled with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
suspicious circumstances. One of these very maids
had introduced herself the preceding night into a
room, where she was forbidden to enter, and had
been detected untying bundles of things and pieces of
stuffs; so that it was apprehended there was a league
with persons without to carry off stolen goods. Zezefôon
was locked up, and sentenced to remain in
durance until she learned to behave better.</p>

<p>Thursday, June 7.—A servant was despatched
over-night with a letter and seven black doses, and
directions how to take them, for the baron and six
others of the suite, with a promise of eight more doses
the next day for the duke and the rest.</p>

<p>This general drenching of fifteen travellers, which
will make many persons laugh, was treated with the
utmost seriousness by Lady Hester Stanhope. It was
a rule with her, as has been said above, never to
let any one pass through her hands without some
potion or another; and truly it may be asserted that
she has saved many from the fevers of the country by
her sage foresight and precautions; but it was too
comical when seven or eight at a time were to be physicked.
To have heard Lady Hester and myself in
conference, weighing the probabilities of under or over
dosing the tall captain of the guards, the mild and
delicately framed baron, and the royal stomach of his
highness, would have been quite a comedy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
The servant had been ordered to arrive at midnight;
the doses were to be administered at two in the morning;
whilst I was to be down at the tents by noon to
see if all had gone on properly. Accordingly, I
mounted my horse after breakfast; but, being rather
late, I did not get there until half-past two. What
was my surprise, when the baron, advancing towards
me, seized my hand. “Be not afraid,” said he; “we
are out of quarantine, and have now no contagion
about us. Upon the representation made, that our
black Mameluke was lying ill of typhus fever only,
the board of health at Beyrout has set us free. Let
me take you to his royal highness, who now can
receive you a little better than he has done.” I accordingly
went with him behind the tombs, where we
found the duke seated on a sofa in the open air, with
his suite around him, and the place rolled and watered
for coolness. He received me with great kindness
and condescension, spoke in repeated terms of gratitude
for Lady Hester’s attention to him, and said his
first duty was to wait on her and thank her: he
therefore charged me to let him know when she would
permit him to pay his respects. Pipes and coffee
were served; and, when I had time to look about me,
I observed the manner in which they had bivouacked
for some days past. Under the hedge, a few yards
off, was an immense pile of burning live coals, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
which the saucepans and boilers were placed, gipsy-fashion:
in this differing from the manner of the
country, where, when cooking in the open air is going
on, temporary stoves are constructed with three or
four square stones, which confine the ashes and make
a draught. In the background I was surprised to see
about half a dozen Italian tumblers, who were preparing
for an exhibition of feats of leaping, &amp;c.
These were a troop, who had that very day arrived
from Beyrout, and whom the prince had engaged to
divert him. Soon after arrived the government secretary,
the colonels of the different regiments in garrison,
the Austrian referendary and his family, &amp;c., to congratulate
the duke on the termination of his confinement.
The exhibition being over, I rose to take leave.
The duke pressed me to stop and dine with him; but
I pleaded my three hours’ ride back in the dark, and
returned home.</p>

<p>Friday, June 8.—When I told Lady Hester that
the duke was coming up, she sent the following letter
to him:—</p>


<p class="p2 center">
<i>To His Royal Highness Maximilian Duke of Bavaria.</i><br>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right r2">
Jôon, June 8, 1838.<br>
</p>

<p class="indent2">Highness,</p>

<p>I cannot sufficiently appreciate the honour you intend
me in wishing to visit my hermitage: but permit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
me to impose these conditions on you—that you say
not a word more, neither you nor the noblemen in
your suite, of those trifling services which you have so
graciously and benevolently accepted. Allow me also
to acquaint your highness that, although I was in
my time a woman of the world, for these last twenty
years I have been nothing but a philosopher, who
turns out of her road for nobody. When Alexander
the Great visited Diogenes, he neither changed his
dress nor moved his tub for him: pardon me, prince,
if I imitate his example.</p>

<p>There was a time when my house was passable:
but now there are many rooms in ruins for want of
repairs—especially a large pavilion in the garden,
tumbling down from an earthquake; so that I could
not lodge more than three or four persons at a time.
What lodging I have for you is, first of all, a little
garden on the east side of my residence, with a small
saloon, and outside of the door two mustabys,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> where
two persons might sleep. Adjoining the saloon is a
bed-room, and at the back of it a sleeping-room for two
valets, with mattresses on the floor, according to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
custom of the country. The saloon has a trellis in
front. Just out of the garden-gate is a little place to
make coffee, or boil water for shaving; and opposite to
it is another room for ordinary strangers, where two
persons can sleep, and where Count Tattenbach was
lodged. For the other servants there is room in one
of the courtyards. As for my own divàn, it has been
in a ruinous state for some years, and I inhabit at
present a badly furnished little room.</p>

<p>I beg your highness will consider the little garden,
and the pavilion in it, which I have just mentioned,
as your own, until the ship which you expect arrives.
You can make your excursions in the mountain when
you like. With you you can bring two or three of
the gentlemen of your suite, and these can make room
for others in their turn. Only, I hope that the baron
and Count Gaiety, as I call him (for, according to
what the doctor tells me, during all your misfortunes
he has always preserved his cheerfulness), will not
come both together, because I have got a great deal to
say to each. Thus, then, I shall expect your royal
highness on Saturday evening.</p>

<p>I have the honour to salute you, prince, with the
most perfect esteem and highest consideration, begging
you to accept, with your known nobleness, the welcome
of the dervise,</p>

<p class="right r2">
<span class="smcap">H. L. Stanhope</span>.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
Saturday, June 9.—The morning came. Preparations
for the reception of the duke had been going on
all the day before. A lamb had been killed; beef had
been sent for from Dayr el Kamar, the only place
where it was sold; fruit and vegetables had come up
from Sayda gardens, and Logmagi had sent fish;
bills of fare had been made out for each meal by Lady
Hester, as a guide to the cook; the silver spoons and
forks had been given out; the servants had put on
their best clothes, and all was bustle for the reception;
for the duke’s liberality to all those who served him
in any shape was very generally talked of, and this
was an infallible spur to all the menials, who anticipated
large vails. Mercenary wretches! whose God
was a <i>bakshýsh</i>, and whose torpor, as Lady Hester
often said, only two things could overcome—money,
and a good flogging.</p>

<p>I waited on Lady Hester early. She told me she
had passed a very bad night, that she was in a burning
fever, and felt so ill it would be impossible to receive
the duke. Her looks were pale, her skin parched and
dry, her breathing short, and she complained of an
increased pain in her side, which had entirely deprived
her of rest. I felt her pulse, and encouraged her to
hope that it was not so bad. “Doctor,” replied she,
“it is nothing: it is when the thunder is in the air
that you should feel it; my pulse beats then like two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
bullets, and if, at that moment, I were to meet a
thousand men opposed to me, I should brave them all:
but, when the storm is over, my pulse falls into its
natural state, and all is quiet again. Anybody but
you would say now I must be bled; and, whether you
approve it or not, bled I shall be: so be so good as to
raise no difficulties, and you must set off immediately
to Dayr Mkhallas, with an apology to his highness;
for I have neither breath nor strength enough to
undergo the exertion of conversation, and put him off
you must.”</p>

<p>I set off to the monastery, and found the duke
surrounded by a numerous company. Nothing could
equal his regret at Lady Hester’s indisposition. Lady
Hester’s state requiring my immediate return, I
hastened back. The bleeding did her good. About
five in the afternoon, the duke and his party were seen
passing on the high-road on their way back to Sayda.
His object in leaving the seaside had been to see Lady
Hester, and, disappointed in that, he returned immediately.
Eventually, this contrariety proved fortunate
for him. He had hardly reached his tents, when the
English steamboat arrived; his passage had been
agreed for, and the duke and his suite, but too happy
to quit a country where he had met with so many
vexations, and had been exposed to so much danger,
were on board in half an hour after her arrival. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
sick negro and four slaves, who had been purchased
in Egypt, were left behind, under the care of Signor
Lapi, with orders likewise to that gentleman that no
expense or care should be spared to forward Wellington’s
recovery.</p>


<div class="footnotes"><p class="center">FOOTNOTES:</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="label">[24]</a> In all cities in Turkey, trades of the same kind are always
in the same street in a cluster. Thus, the saddlers are in one
street, the druggists or grocers in another, the shoemakers in
another: and it is customary to say, when directing to a place
in a town—“Close to the goldsmiths’ bazar, beyond the <a id="chg8"></a>corn market,
before you come to the Blacksmiths’ Street,” &amp;c.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="label">[25]</a> What the traveller related to me had almost slipped my
memory; but having since met with it in an Arabic book, I
here translate it.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="label">[26]</a> The Mahometans, imbued with the persuasion that whatever
is the will of the Almighty must come to pass, and that resignation
to his decrees is their duty, never refuse assistance to
persons afflicted with contagious maladies. Hence may be seen
that marked difference in their conduct and that of Christians
during the prevalence of the plague; the former attending on
the sick bed of their relatives, the latter flying from them and
leaving them to die through neglect.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="label">[27]</a> Thus, while writing out these memorandums in August,
1839, I learn that the plague has re-appeared at Jerusalem,
Jaffa, and at other places, where, in 1838, a few cases announced
its presence. We shall see whether a quarantine establishment
will save Syria: I think it will not. The Turkish authorities,
when left to themselves, invariably resist the introduction of all
quarantine regulations; or, at least, they did so in the beginning
of this century: it is only when the preponderance of European
influence, backed by orders from their own government,
compels submission, that they unwillingly adopt them. But
Mahomet Ali and Ibrahim Pasha, when spoken of, are not to be
considered as Mahometans. Imbued with Machiavelian principles,
gathered from their intercourse with Europeans, they
were not slow to see that, in fit hands, a quarantine establishment
has little more to do with health than it has with the
growth of the sugar-cane, or any extraneous employment. A
Lazaretto, as conducted in Piedmont or France, is no more nor
less than a fiscal measure and a legalized panoptikon. It is,
first of all, subsidiary to the Customs, and next, a most efficient
mode for staying travellers, crews of ships, and all manner of
moving things entering on a territory, then and there to be
enabled in cool despotism to examine letters, pry into men’s
business, learn their opinions, destination, &amp;c., and, finally, to
tax them in their money and substance, in the most undisguised
and complete manner yet invented by designing rulers. Quarantine
ought never to exist in a free country, neither ought passports.
A town properly built, ventilated, and cleansed, will
not foster contagion, and passports do not facilitate the detection
of offenders. The plague still visits the Levant, and Pichegru
remained undiscovered in France for two years, in spite of all
the passports and all the police of Buonaparte, his mortal
enemy.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="label">[28]</a> This was the report of a suit in one of the county courts
of assize, wherein, under somewhat similar circumstances, a
surgeon was acquitted.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_29" href="#FNanchor_29" class="label">[29]</a> It will be recollected that Sulyman Pasha was originally a
French corporal in Buonaparte’s army.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_30" href="#FNanchor_30" class="label">[30]</a> A mustaby is an estrade, or raised stone bench, in shape
what a shop-counter would be against a wall, made at the
doors of houses in the East for people to sit cross-legged on to
enjoy the fresh air, or sometimes at the doors of rooms for servants
to sleep on as sentries to those within.</p>

<p class="p2">Lady Hester got up in the evening. The heat was
now so great, that the covers of books, as they lay on
the table, would curl up at the corners, and the joinings
of furniture split. A host of a kind of small
May-bugs made their appearance at sunset, and large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
cockchafers, impudent as is every description of bug,
fly, or bird, in this country, kept us all in a state of
petty warfare, which was succeeded, when bed-time
came, by a sleepless contest with those horrid tormentors,
the musquitoes.</p>

<p>Lady Hester spoke a good deal about the property
supposed to be left her. “Those,” she said, “who
wrote me word about it would not deceive me; they
were persons I have perfect reliance on. They were
afraid to write names; but when they said that this
property was come to me from the two plainest persons
of my acquaintance, those two must have been
Lord K. and his wife.”</p>

<p>The duke had asked me, when I was with him,
whether I thought Lady Hester would be displeased
if he sent her his portrait from Europe. I answered,
“She could not but be pleased to have what, next to
seeing him, would best recall his highness to her
mind.” But, when I told Lady Hester of this, she
said, “No; I must write to him, and prevent his
sending it.”</p>

<p>Sunday, June 10, 1838.—I rode down to Sayda,
not aware of the duke’s departure, and I found, to my
astonishment, that the duke, tents, and everybody
had disappeared, except the poor black, Wellington;
so now, having nothing to distract my attention, I
went and conversed with him. He asked for a loose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
dressing-gown, warm stockings, as the cold struck up
to his bowels from the stones, and a pillow for his head.
This, together with tea and sugar, a teapot, and some
other little things, were sent down to him.</p>

<p>Tuesday, June 12.—Lady Hester’s fever was somewhat
abated. According to the date, the steamboat
had arrived at Beyrout, and her expectations were
wound up to a fearful height, in the hope that this
time, at all events, a letter must have come from Sir
Francis Burdett. Before noon, an express was
announced: he was bearer of a letter to me to say
that the steamboat had brought nothing. I knew not
how to communicate the sad intelligence to her ladyship.
When she heard it, she made a turn in her
bed, and, with an exclamation of “Oh, Lord!” she
said—“Doctor, the die is cast: the sooner you take
yourself off, the better. I have no money—you can
be of no use to me—I shall write no more letters,
shall break up my establishment, wall up the gate,
and, with a girl and a boy to wait on me, resign myself
to my fate.—Let me have none of your foolish
reasoning on the subject. Tell your family they may
make their preparations, and in a fortnight’s time you
must be gone. Who knows? perhaps Prince Pückler
Muskau, after all his pretended interest about my
affairs, has never sent the correspondence to Europe:
he told you in three months we should see the letters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
in the papers; and yet the papers neither come, nor
do we hear from him: and do you think, after this,
one can have any confidence in anybody?”</p>

<p>Wednesday, June 13.—I was glad to pass twenty-four
hours without seeing her ladyship; for she was
in too melancholy a humour to derive consolation,
except from her own reflections: there she was most
sure to find relief; for, endued with a sanguine temperament,
and always building castles in the air, her
depression never was of long continuance. In the evening,
when I went to her, she dwelt on the necessity of
repose for me, now old age had come upon me, in order
to reconcile me to a separation which she seemed to
think would give me pain.</p>

<p>Thursday, June 14.—I rode down to see Wellington,
the black. His quarantine was to last in all
forty days. He was alone in the building before described,
called the Shemaôony, lying with his mattress
on the stones, in the open air, and with an invalided
soldier to attend on him, who of course was condemned
to the same length of quarantine as himself. Wellington
thanked me for the things which had been
sent him. “Ah, sir,” said he, “this is not like
my own country. At New York I should, even in a
hospital, be attended by a good nurse; I should have
my comfortable cup of tea, my bread pudding; and
what the doctor ordered me would be properly administered:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
but that man” (pointing to the soldier)
“wants to kill me. He is tired of being as it were in
prison, and last night he beat me—yes, he beat me,
ill as I am, because I woke him to assist me in my
helplessness. My swelling is broken too; and it
wants rags and plasters, and I have not strength to
dress it myself; for I am so weak! look, see how my
arms and legs are reduced in size. Tell that lady
who is so kind to me, that, when I get well, I will
bring her some of the beads and cockle-shells, and
other curiosities I bought at Jerusalem; and I have
got some fine cotton stockings that I brought from
New York,”—“Oh! but Wellington,” said I, interrupting
him, “the lady is not in need of such things,
although your feelings are not the less creditable on
that account. She is a great lady, like the wife of
your President, and she loves to do good to everybody.”
“God bless her!” cried the poor fellow;
“and it was so thoughtful of her to send me this soft
pillow to put under my back, when I only asked for
one for my head; for, do you know, it was the very
thing I wanted, I have got such sores down my backbone
from lying so long in the same position! Will
you be so good as to explain to that man that he must
make a fire, and boil the water here, when I want
tea? for Lufloofy brings the water from the town, and
it is quite cold before he gets here. And do, sir, tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
him he is not to beat me—but no! perhaps you had
better not; for in the night he will be revenged on
me, and who is to help me here? Oh, sir, if you
knew what I suffer! I have not had a clean shirt,
until those you sent me, since the day of our reaching
this place.”</p>

<p>On leaving Wellington, I rode into Sayda, and
going to Signor Lapi, where I found the governor’s
secretary, I told them how the soldier maltreated the
poor sick man. He immediately provided another
attendant, an old Christian, named Anastasius, and,
accompanying me to the Shemaôony himself, he menaced
the soldier with a good bastinadoing, ordered
him to the corner of the building farthest removed
from Wellington’s bed, and threatened to have him
shot if he dared molest either the black or Anastasius.
Having settled this affair, I went to one of the city
baths, called Hamàm el Gidýd, where I was obliged
to hurry myself greatly to make way for the women,
who, their time being come, were raising a clamour
about the door. Baths are generally open for men
until noon, and for women until sunset.</p>

<p>To-day news had come that the Druzes had advanced
as far as Hasbéyah and Rashéyah about a
day’s journey from Sayda; that they had killed the
governor, and had spread consternation throughout
the district. This news was confirmed by Khosrô<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
Effendi and Selim Effendi, two gentlemen in the governor’s
service.</p>

<p>On my return, I had occasion to witness the successful
results of the Emir Beshýr’s measure for the
destruction of the locusts. Immense swarms of these
insects had come from the south-east, and settled for
many leagues around during the month of ——,
laying their eggs in holes in the ground, which they
bore, as far as I could observe, with a sort of auger,
which nature has sheathed in their tails. Their eggs
form a small cylinder about as big as a maggot, and
in minute appearance like an ear of Turkey corn,
all the little eggs, as so many pins’ heads, lying in
rows with that beautiful uniformity so constant in all
the works of the Creator. How many of these conglomerate
little masses each female locust lays I know
not, but those I handled were enough to equal in size
a hazel-nut, and, united by some glutinous matter,
they are hatched about May. But no sooner had the
swarms laid their eggs, than, to prevent their hatching,
an order was enforced all through the district where
the locusts had settled, obliging every member of a
family above a certain age to bring for so many days
(say) half a gallon of eggs to the village green, where,
lighted faggots being thrown on them, they were consumed.
The order was in full force for, probably,
three weeks, until it was supposed that the greatest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
part of the eggs had been dug up and destroyed.
The peasants know by certain signs where the females
have laid their eggs: but the utmost vigilance may
overlook some ovaries; and, as each clot of the size of
a nut may produce 5,000 locusts (for the peasants
told me that each separate cluster of the size of a
maggot contained more than a hundred eggs), it may
be easily imagined how they swarm as soon as they
are hatched. What one first sees is a black heap,
about the size of the brim of a coalheaver’s hat. A
day or two after the heap spreads for some yards
round, and consists of little black grasshopper-like
things, all jumping here and there with such dazzling
agility as to fatigue the eye. Soon afterwards they
begin to march in one direction, and to eat; and then
they spread so widely through a whole province that a
person may ride for leagues and leagues, and his horse
will never put a foot to the ground without crushing
three or four at a step: it is then the peasants rush
to their fields, if fortunate enough to meet the vanguard
of this formidable and destructive army. With
hoes, shovels, pickaxes and the like, they dig a trench
as deep as time will permit across their march, and
there, as the locusts, which never turn aside for anything,
enter, they bury, burn, and crush them, until
exhaustion compels them to desist, or until, as was
the case this year, from previous destruction of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
eggs, and from having only partial swarms to contend
with, they succeed in nearly annihilating them. When
they fly, the whole village population comes out with
kettles, pots, and pans, and, by an incessant din, tries
to prevent their settling. The greatest enemy to
locusts is a high wind, which carries them to the sea
and drowns them, or, opposing their course, drives
them back to the desert, probably to perish for want
of sustenance.</p>

<p>In the evening, Lady Hester was in very low
spirits. She said many unpleasant things to me,
calling it frankness. She made a long tirade on my
obstinacy in not listening to her prophetic voice. She
said—“Wherever you go, you will regret not having
followed my counsels, whether in Syria or in Europe.
I should not,” she added, “have bestowed so much
time on you, but I wish you well, and am sorry you
will not put yourself in my train. You can be of no
use to me, for I shall want persons of determination,
judgment, and courage—neither of which you possess:
but I know from what cause all your errors come—from
having given up your liberty to a woman.”—Such
was her opinion of what she called the slavery
of marriage.</p>

<p>Monday, June 18.—I was mounting my horse to
go to Sayda, when a person on a sorry nag, dressed in
the nizàm dress, passed my gate, followed by a servant.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
“Good morning,” said I, in Arabic (for it is a sin
almost not to give a good day to friend or stranger in
these countries), and, receiving a reply in the same
language, I concluded he was some officer of the
Pasha’s come on business, and I rode off. On arriving
at Sayda, I was asked if I had met a Frank
on the road, and replied no; until, by the description,
I learned that the person in the nizàm dress was a
European. “Of what nation he is,” said my informant,
“I can’t tell; we spoke to him in three or
four languages, but it was all the same to him—he
answered fluently in all. There is his lodging” (and
he pointed to a small tent pitched in the middle of
the khan quadrangle); “for we told him we had not
a room to give him, owing to the earthquake; but he
said he preferred being near us to going into the town,
and so there he slept. When he wanted a guide up
to mylady’s house, we told him that he must first
send to ask permission to visit her; but he maintained
there was no occasion for that; so we left him
to his own course.”</p>

<p>According to the news that I collected, the signs of
the times were rather alarming. Whilst I was holding
the above conversation, a peasant entered the khan
gate with a brace of pistols in his girdle. “There
they are,” whispered a Turk to me. “A fortnight ago,
that peasant would have no more dared to come into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
town with his arms—but now they hang them on a
peg in their cottages, especially in and about Nablôos,
and set the soldiers and the pasha at defiance; and
the garrison here is as mute as a mouse. God knows
how things will turn out! In the mountain there is
even a fanatic shaykh who goes about haranguing the
people, advising them to pay no more <i>miri</i> to Ibrahim
Pasha. A man, too, has been murdered on the
Beyrout road.”</p>

<p>When I returned to the Dar in the evening, I saw
Lady Hester. Nothing was said about the stranger’s
arrival, although, by the stranger’s garden-door being
open, I knew he was installed there; but, according
to the etiquette observed in the house, I made no
inquiries, judging that this was to be a mysterious
visit, with which I had nothing to do; so I went
home. It must appear very strange to the reader,
that there should be a European so near to me, who
would have to dine alone when I would willingly have
had his company; yet, without seriously offending
Lady Hester, I could neither invite him, nor even pay
him a visit—but such was her character. With her
everything must be secret, and everything exclusive;
and if ever there was a being who would have appropriated
all authority to herself, and have shouldered
out the rest of mankind from the enjoyment of any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
privilege but such as she thought fit to concede, it was
Lady Hester Stanhope.</p>

<p>Tuesday, June 19.—This morning the conversation
turned on the Druze insurrection. Lady Hester now
assumed the air of a person who, having made extraordinary
prophecies, saw that the time of their
accomplishment had arrived. “I foretold all this,”
said she: “in a short time you will not be able to
ride from here to Sayda; the country will be overrun
with armed men; but I shall be as cool, from first to
last, as at a <i lang="fr">fête</i>. All the cowards may go: I want
only those who can send a ball where I direct them.
Why do I keep such men as Seyd Ahmed and some
others? because I know they would mind no more
killing a score of people than eating their dinner.
You wanted me to get rid of them, and blamed my
<i>tubba</i> [disposition] because I had such fellows about
me, whose plots you are afraid of:—why, yes, they
were uneasy and troublesome, because they had nothing
to do: but I knew the time would come when
they would be useful, as you will see.”</p>

<p>Finding that Lady Hester seemed, for some unknown
reason, to wish for my absence, I took my leave of
her until Wednesday evening.</p>

<p>Wednesday, June 20.—I rose rather late, and was
told by my family that a curious figure of a European<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
on a mule, followed by a servant dressed as a sailor,
and coming from Lady Hester’s house, had passed
our gate just before, with two mule-loads of luggage,
altogether bearing the appearance of a travelling pedlar.
“What can this mean?” thought I: “this
cannot be the stranger I heard of in Sayda, for he
was dressed in the costume of the country; but perhaps
this is some travelling merchant, who has been
to show his European wares to her ladyship.”</p>

<p>Sunset came, and, after dinner, I joined Lady
Hester. She began, as I entered the saloon, with—“Well,
doctor, I have got rid of him.”—“Of whom!”
I asked. “Oh!” rejoined she, “such a deep one!—a
Russian spy from the embassy at Constantinople:
but he got nothing out of me, although he tried in all
sorts of ways. I as good as told him he was a spy:
and the Russians employ such clever men, that I
thought it best you should not see him; for he would
have pumped you without your suspecting his design,
and have been more than a match for you. I dare
say he is affronted because I packed him off so soon.
I told him his fortune. You should have seen his
splaws and have heard him talk—it was quite a comedy.
He asked me if it was true that I could describe
a person’s character merely by looking at him.
‘Yes,’ said I, ‘and, although I don’t see very well,
and the candles give a very bad light, I will describe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
yours, if you like,’ and, without giving him time to
stop me, I hit it off so exactly, that he exclaimed—‘Really,
my lady, it is quite, quite wonderful!’ But,
now he is gone, I must tell you that there is another
person here—a sort of <i lang="fr">savant</i>. Here, take this little
book which he has given to me; but, you know, I
don’t pretend to understand such things; it is something
he has written about hieroglyphics: look at it,
and then go and sit a little with him.”</p>

<p>After casting my eye over the work, I went to the
strangers’ garden, and introduced myself. It was
Dr. Lœve, the great orientalist and linguist, whom
the newspapers had designated as librarian to his
royal highness the D. of S., although I had thought
that another gentleman of the medical profession held
that honourable post. His knowledge of tongues was
prodigious. I passed an hour or two with him, whilst
he explained some of the objects of his Eastern researches.
One thing struck me very forcibly, that, of
all Europeans who study the literature of the East,
the Jew has a decided advantage, inasmuch as his
school studies in Hebrew render the transition to
Arabic a step of no more difficulty than from Latin to
Italian.</p>

<p>When I went back to Lady Hester, and told her
that Dr. Lœve, as I thought, had been sent out at the
expense of one of the oriental societies, or else at that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
of the Duke of S., and that he had spoken very highly
of his royal highness’s library and learning, Lady
Hester halloed out—“Oh! Lord, doctor—the D. of
S. learned! If I were to see him, I would tell him
when and where he was laid across his horse drunk.—But
I loved all the princes—all, except George the
Fourth;—they were so lively, so good-natured;—people
who would laugh at a straw.”</p>

<p>Thursday, June 21.—I rode down to Shemaôony
to see Wellington, but not without some misgivings;
for the groom who accompanied me related several
things which made me suspect that the road was no
longer safe. He had heard that between Tyr and
Acre there was no passing: “and,” said he, “what
is to prevent any desperate villain, or gang of villains,
from attacking anybody anywhere? Our very governors
hardly dare stir out of the towns; and who
is to go in pursuit of robbers now? They know that;
for the country is ready to rise, and in four or five
days we shall perhaps see strange doings.”</p>

<p>After visiting the black, whose state was far from
improving, I entered Sayda. I learned that from
some villages a hundred and fifty horsemen had
marched off the preceding night to join the insurgents;
that, at Garýfy, a distance of four hours from Jôon,
cattle had been carried off; that between Acre and
Sayda travelling had become dangerous. At a village<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
called Helliléah, the people had shut up their houses,
and taken refuge in the city: nay, the monks of
Dayr el Mkhallas had packed up their valuables and
church ornaments, and sent them to Sayda. The
people in the gardens had also taken the alarm, and
no longer slept there, as is customary in the summer
season.</p>

<p>When I got back to the Dar, I told all this news to
Lady Hester Stanhope. “Oh!” said she, “that’s not
all—the people of Jôon are in a fright, and were
going to desert the village; and Fatôom has been
asking leave to bring her mother’s cow into my cow-house:
but I sent word over to them to remain
where they were, and that no harm should come to
them.”</p>

<p>M. Guys, before setting off to Aleppo, had raised
on a bill of her ladyship’s 27,000 piasters: these
were in the house. “Would it be right,” said I,
“to pay the servants the six months’ wages due to
them, so that, if anything happens, each person may
take care of his own?”—“Oh!” answered Lady Hester,
“I don’t fear; I would throw all my doors open, if
the Druzes were on the outside, and should not be
afraid that anybody would touch me.”</p>

<p>My family in the mean time remained in total
ignorance of what was going on around them; they
ate, drank, slept, and walked out, totally <a id="chg4"></a>unconscious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
of danger. I did not apprehend that these reports
would come to their ears, for they understood very
little Arabic, and, even if they had, the Arabs, generally
speaking, have so much tact in knowing when
they ought to be silent, that I thought myself safe in
that respect: but I was mistaken. An old chattering
washerwoman, in bringing home the linen, began a
long speech, addressing herself to me, as I was smoking
at the door, about the risk that women ran in being
away from any habitation in these lawless times. “Do
you know,” said she, “there are deserters in the woods
and disabled soldiers in the high roads? And it was
but yesterday that those ladies were an hour’s distance
off in the forest, that leads to the river: for some
neighbours of mine, who had taken their grists to the
water-mill, saw them. By the Prophet! you do
wrong to let them go so far. We had yesterday two
of Ibrahim Pasha’s soldiers in the village begging,
each with one hand only; for the Druzes had taken
them prisoners and cut off their right hands;<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> but
though they can’t fight, they are very dangerous men:
for, you see, they are Egyptians.” The woman talked
with much vehemence, and, although I silenced her,
by answering that I would inquire into it, she had
said enough to excite suspicion, in those who stood by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
listening, that something was not right, and I was
obliged to disclose part of the truth.</p>

<p>Friday, June 22.—Lady Hester dictated a very uncivil
letter to Signor Lapi, the Austrian referendary, in
which she said things as if coming from me. It was
not an unusual way with her to employ my name to
repeat her opinions, by which people were offended,
who afterwards vented their spite in some way or
another: it was one of her many manœuvres to keep
people aloof from each other when it suited her purposes.
Twenty years before, I had a serious quarrel
with Shaykh Ibrahim (Mr. Burckhardt) in the same
way, she not having so high an opinion of that
gentleman as people in general had: but this was
independent of his literary merits, and on different
grounds.</p>

<p>Lady Hester related to me a dream that some one
had had about her, in which a hand waving over her
head, and several crowned heads humbled before her,
were interpreted to indicate the greatness that just
now, as she flattered herself, awaited her. What reason
she had for thinking that relief from all her troubles
was near at hand the reader has had opportunity of
judging. She was always disposed, however, to see
things in their brightest aspect—yesterday plunged
into difficulties, and to-day extricating herself, if not
in reality at least in imagination. “I am,” said she,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
“like the man in the Eastern story, who, imprisoned
in a dungeon, and nearly starved to death, found in a
poor sailor an old acquaintance, who conveyed to him
secretly a basin of warm soup: but, just as he was
putting it to his mouth, a rat fell from the ceiling,
and knocked it out of his hand. Reduced thus to the
lowest pitch of wretchedness, and seeing nothing left
for him but to die, at the critical moment came a
firmán from Constantinople to cut off the head of the
pasha who had thrown him into prison, and he was
saved. So it is with me: I cannot be worse off
than I am; I shall, therefore, when the next steamboat
comes, see what it brings; and, if I hear no news
about the property that was left me, I shall get rid of
you and everybody, and of all the women; and, with
one black slave and Logmagi, I shall order the gateway
to be walled up, leaving only room enough for my
cows to go in and out to pasture, and I shall have no
communication with any human being. I shall write
to Lord Palmerston before you go, and tell him that,
as he has thrown an aspersion on my name, I shall
remain walled in here until he publicly removes it:
and if he, or anybody, writes to me, there will be no
answer; for, when you are gone, I shall have nobody
to write for me.—This sort of life perhaps will suit
me best, after all. I have often wished that I could
have a room in my garden, and, lying there with only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
some necessary covering, slip from my bed as I was
into my garden, and after a turn or two slip back
again: I do assure you I should neither be low-spirited
nor dull.”</p>

<p>To-day a letter was brought from an English traveller,
Mr. M., to Lady Hester, the purport of which
was that a gentleman of an ancient and honourable
family was desirous of paying his respects to her.
Lady Hester asked me to go down to Sayda, to call
on him and say she should be happy to see him: accordingly,
next morning, I went. I found a gentleman,
of about forty or forty-two years of age, installed
at the customary lodging of the English, and, after
delivering my message and conversing with him a
little while, I left him to see Wellington, the black,
and go in search of news. I learned from Khosrô
Effendi, the government secretary, that one of Ibrahim’s
regiments, sent to quell the rising in Hasbéyah
and Rashéyah, had been compelled, by the superior
numbers of the insurgents, to shut themselves up in
the castle, and were there closely besieged, expecting
a reinforcement from Damascus to their relief.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Towards Jerusalem some manifestations of rising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
had been made, and nearer to Jôon some bodies of
insurgents, in their way from different villages to join
the main body in Rashéyah and the Horàn, had, in
passing Btedýn, the Emir Beshýr’s residence, uttered
loud and reviling menaces and cries. The Emir,
being deprived of arms to put his dependants in a
state of defence, had sent to Beyrout to demand 400
muskets, and had induced the Patriarch of the Maronite
Christians to assemble some of the chief shaykhs,
and to bind them with an oath not to join the Druzes.
He had despatched couriers to the Metoualy country
(the mountains running parallel with the sea from
Sayda to Acre, and in some measure a continuation of
Mount Lebanon), calling on the chieftains to hold
their allegiance to Ibrahim Pasha. But it was considered
that all these were measures of little use,
should the Christians and Metoualis see a chance of
expelling their oppressors. The inhabitants of the
peaceable villages kept themselves in readiness on the
first alarm to fly to the towns for security. Looking,
however, dispassionately at the probabilities of success
between the rival parties, it is not likely, considering
that the Egyptian satrap holds all the strong places,
that the Druzes can do anything more than carry on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
a harassing warfare, unless powerful aid comes from
without, and ships of war blockade Acre, Beyrout,
and the other ports.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>I saw Wellington: his case presented little hope.
Dysentery had supervened, and, feeble as he already
was, I judged it impossible that he could survive.</p>

<p>Sunday, June 24.—Mr. M. came up, and remained,
I forget whether two or three days. He told me he
was of Trinity College, Cambridge, but had been a
long time abroad. Lady Hester said of him, “I like
to converse with such people as are what you call
country squires—one hears a great many anecdotes
from them. Sometimes he makes very sensible remarks,
and sometimes he is very strange. He asked
me if I knew the Emir Beshýr; and, when I was giving
him some information about him, all of a sudden he
asked me if I liked dancing when I lived in England.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
He goes from one thing to another, like a dog in a
fair:” (I laughed):—“yes, doctor, just like a dog
that goes from one booth to another, sniffing here and
there, and stealing gingerbread nuts. When he sat
with me in the evening, he was constantly turning his
head to the window, which was open, as if he thought
somebody was coming in that way.”</p>

<p>Tuesday, June 26.—Mr. M. went away.</p>

<p>Wednesday, June 27.—A letter came from two
more travellers, dated from the quarantine ground,
where the black lay ill. Colonel Hazeta, the writer,
informed her ladyship that he had travelled overland
from Calcutta, and was commissioned to deliver to her
a letter from her nephew, Colonel T. Taylor; but he
alleged the impossibility of being the bearer of it himself,
owing to the necessity he was under of proceeding
onward to Beyrout, and performing his quarantine
there. He was accompanied by Dr. Mill.</p>

<p>Thursday, June 28.—I received a note, acquainting
me with the death of Wellington, and I rode down to
inform myself of the circumstances of his end. By
Signor Lapi’s care he was decently interred in the
Catholic burial-ground at Sayda. What religion he
was of I never heard him say; but he was what is
called a pious youth, and told me his mother had
brought him up in the practice of virtue and godliness;
and, from what I saw of him, I believe he spoke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
truly; for he was of great singleness of mind, artless,
ingenuous, and grateful to the duke, his master, and
to Lady Hester, for the kindnesses they had shown
him. But who shall console his poor mother!</p>

<p>I collected a little news, from which the Pasha’s
affairs seemed to wear a better aspect. He had
marched, it was said, with two regiments and some
field-pieces against the rebels at Hasbéyah, and had
sacked the place. The Horàn, it was reported, was
also reduced to obedience.</p>

<p>Friday, June 29.—To-day Lady Hester wrote a
letter to Lord Palmerston, in answer to one she had
received from him, which I shall first transcribe.</p>


<p class="p2 center">
<i>Lord Palmerston to Lady Hester Stanhope.</i><br>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right r2">
Foreign Office, April 25, 1838.<br>
</p>

<p class="indent2">Madam,</p>

<p>I am commanded by the Queen to acquaint you that
I have laid before her Majesty your letter of the 12th
of February, of this year.</p>

<p>It has been my duty to explain to her Majesty the
circumstances which may be supposed to have led to
your writing that letter; and I have now to state to
your ladyship that any communications which have been
made to you on the matters to which your letter refers,
either through the friends of your family or through
her Majesty’s agent and consul-general at Alexandria,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
have been suggested by nothing but a desire to save
your ladyship from the embarrassments which might
arise, if the parties who have claims upon you were to
call upon the consul-general to act according to the
strict line of his duty, under the capitulations between
Great Britain and the Porte.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be, madam, your ladyship’s
most obedient humble servant,</p>

<p class="right r2">
<span class="smcap">Palmerston</span>.<br>

<p class="p2 center">
<i>Lady Hester Stanhope to Lord Palmerston.</i><br>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right r2">
Jôon, Mount Lebanon, July 1, 1838.<br>
</p>

<p class="indent2">My Lord,</p>

<p>If your diplomatic despatches are as obscure as the
one which now lies before me, it is no wonder that
England should cease to have that proud preponderance
in her foreign relations which she once could
boast of.</p>

<p>Your lordship tells me that you have thought it
your duty to explain to the Queen the subject which
caused me to address her Majesty: I should have
thought, my lord, that it would have been your duty
to have made those explanations prior to having taken
the liberty of using her Majesty’s name, and alienated
from her and her country a subject, who, the great
and small must acknowledge, (however painful it may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
be to some) has raised the English name in the East
higher than any one has yet done, besides having made
many philosophical researches of every description for
the advantage of human nature at large, and this
without having spent one farthing of the public money.
Whatever may be the surprise created in the minds of
statesmen of the old school respecting the conduct of
government towards me, I am not myself in the least
astonished; for, when the son of a king, with a view
of enlightening his own mind and the world in general,
had devoted part of his private fortune to the purchase
of a most invaluable library at Hamburgh, he was
flatly refused an exemption from the custom-house
duties; but, if report speaks true, had an application
been made to pass bandboxes, millinery, inimitable
wigs, and invaluable rouge, it would have been instantly
granted by her Majesty’s ministers, if we may judge
by precedents. Therefore, my lord, I have nothing to
complain of; yet I shall go on fighting my battles,
campaign after campaign.</p>

<p>Your lordship gives me to understand that the insult
which I have received was considerately bestowed upon
me to avoid some dreadful, unnameable misfortune
which was pending over my head. I am ready to meet
with courage and resignation every misfortune it may
please God to visit me with, but certainly not insult
from man. If I can be accused of high crimes and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
misdemeanours, and that I am to stand in dread of the
punishment thereof, let me be tried, as I believe I have
a right to be, by my peers; if not, then by the voice
of the people. Disliking the English because they are
no longer English—no longer that hardy, honest, bold
people that they were in former times—yet, as some
few of this race must remain, I should rely in confidence
upon their integrity and justice, when my case
had been fully examined.</p>

<p>It is but fair to make your lordship aware, that, if
by the next packet there is nothing definitively settled
respecting my affairs, and that I am not cleared in the
eyes of the world of aspersions, intentionally or unintentionally
thrown upon me, I shall break up my
household and build up the entrance-gate to my
premises: there remaining, as if I was in a tomb, till
my character has been done justice to, and a public
acknowledgment put in the papers, signed and sealed
by those who have aspersed me. There is no trifling
with those who have Pitt blood in their veins upon the
subject of integrity, nor expecting that their spirit
would ever yield to the impertinent interference of
consular authority.</p>

<p>Meanly endeavouring (as Colonel Campbell has
attempted to do) to make the origin of this business an
application of the Viceroy of Egypt to the English
Government, I must, without having made any inquiries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
upon the subject, exculpate his highness from
so low a proceeding. His known liberality in all such
cases, from the highest to the lowest class of persons,
is such as to make one the more regret his extraordinary
and reprehensible conduct towards his great master,
and that such a man should become totally blinded by
vanity and ambition, which must in the end prove his
perdition—an opinion I have loudly given from the
beginning.</p>

<p>Your lordship talks to me of the capitulations with
the Sublime Porte: what has that to do with a private
individual’s having exceeded his finances in trying to
do good? If there is any punishment for that, you
had better begin with your ambassadors, who have often
indebted themselves at the different courts of Europe
as well as at Constantinople. I myself am so attached
to the Sultan, that, were the reward of such conduct
that of losing my head, I should kiss the sabre wielded
by so mighty a hand, yet, at the same time, treat with
the most ineffable contempt your trumpery agents, as
I shall never admit of their having the smallest power
over me—if I did, I should belie my origin.</p>

<p class="right r2">
<span class="smcap">Hester Lucy Stanhope.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Here let me ask the reader whether Lady Hester
had not indeed a right to be indignant with the
minister who then directed the foreign affairs of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
country, for the illiberal manner in which he gratified
his spleen and mortified vanity. He had not the
power of directly stopping the payment of her pension,
it being a parliamentary grant; but he had recourse
to the unworthy artifice of directing his agent not to
sign the certificate of her life, without which her
pension could not be paid. Nothing can be added to
the well-merited castigation inflicted upon him, and
he has brought down upon himself the condemnation
of all men of good breeding and generous sentiment.
What his present feelings on the subject may be it is
impossible to say; but I would fain hope that there
are few who are disposed to envy him, much less to
follow his example.</p>

<p>This day an English sloop of war hove-to off Sayda.
The captain of her sent for the English consular agent
alongside, and what took place on this occasion may
serve as an example of the necessity of having Englishmen,
and not foreigners, as consular agents in distant
countries. The precise object that the captain of the
sloop had in view of course can only be known to himself;
but what queries he put to Mr. Abella, the
agent, and what answers he received, very soon transpired.
Since, how could it be otherwise, when the
agent was a native of Syria, and understood no
language but Arabic? Being, therefore, summoned
to the ship, which he could not go aboard, as she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
could not communicate with persons from the shore
until her bill of health had been examined by the
health officers, he was first of all compelled to take
some one as an interpreter between the captain and
himself, and then to hold his parley from the boat to
the ship’s quarter; but, as the interpreter might only
speak Italian, and the captain only English, a third
aid is required, and we will suppose an officer to be
called, who takes the question from the captain’s
mouth in English, repeats it in Italian to the agent’s
interpreter, who translates it into Arabic; and then
the answer goes back through the same channels: so
that it must necessarily happen that the sense and the
wording undergo a material change. But there is yet
a greater evil. If the questions relate to matters of
importance, as the progress of the Druze insurrection
(for example), or the probability of Ibrahim Pasha’s
success or defeat, how is the consular agent, so circumstanced,
to give a faithful account? for, should he
divulge matters unfavourable to the Pasha’s cause, his
well-being, and perhaps his life, may be endangered:
since, although he himself, as an agent in the English
service, receives a certain protection, he may have
brothers and relations who are at the Pasha’s mercy:
nay, he himself, perhaps an agent to-day and dismissed
to-morrow, may be left to cope with powerful
enemies for the rest of his life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
Now, the French government secures Frenchmen for
consuls and agents, and the English government, one
would think, ought to act on the same principle. Let
it not be said that men could not be found—native
Englishmen—willing to banish themselves to these
countries, and that for a very trifling salary. Among
the half-pay officers of the army and navy might be
selected numbers, who, even for so small a stipend as
two hundred a year, would willingly accept such
situations; because a very short residence would show
them that, with economy, a hundred a year in the
Levant is equivalent to two at home.</p>

<p>In affairs, where the conflicting interests of English
and Mahometans, or disputes between travellers and
natives, are to be settled, it is absurd to suppose that
an agent, accustomed to cringe and fawn to the Turks
all his life, will, or can, ever obtain redress for the party
whose country he represents: it is impossible!</p>

<p>Saturday, June 30.—Lady Hester had sent to
Dayr el Kamar for old Pierre, and he arrived this
day. He brought news of a very different nature
from that which I had learned at Sayda on the preceding
Thursday. Ibrahim Pasha had been defeated
by the insurgents, and had retreated as far as Zahly,
a burgh overlooking the Bkâa, on the north-east slope
of Mount Lebanon. In consequence of this, the road
from Dayr el Kamar to Damascus was too dangerous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
to pass, and all the muleteers were stopped at those
two places, afraid to cross the intervening plain.</p>

<p>I was surprised in the evening, when conversing
with her ladyship, to see how the strongest minds are
borne into the regions of fancy by what, with people of
common sense, would be considered as mere visionary
absurdities. I believe I have related elsewhere how a
person, having gained the confidence of Lady Hester,
told her he knew of a book that foretold the destinies
of persons, which book he procured at her desire, and
out of it offered to answer any questions she chose to
put about anybody. “I would not,” said Lady Hester,
when narrating the story, “ask him what would happen
in Syria, because I conceive the course of events may
be predicted by a man of great sagacity in any country,
where he has cast a wistful eye on things passing
around him; but I fixed on you, and asked him,
‘What is the doctor doing in Europe?’ The man
opened his book, and read, and explained thus:—‘I
see an elderly person sitting up in his bed, and by
the bed-side a young woman kneeling, whilst she
entreats and implores the elderly person not to take
some journey, or go on some voyage,’ which of the two
he could not precisely say. Now, doctor, that you
know was exactly the case: for did not Mrs. M. some
one day cry and beg of you not to go and join me?
I am sure it was so. I next asked him about myself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
He consulted his book, and said, I was to be witness
to great battles, or be near where they were fought,
and that one of the contests would be so bloody that,
on one side, not a person would be left to tell the story:
this battle, moreover, was to be fought on a plain
three miles long and three broad, near Zahly, and upon
Mount Lebanon. But,” added Lady Hester, “I never
could find any solution to this prophecy until now;
and the battle between Ibrahim Pasha and the insurgents
clearly was the one meant. Neither could I
discover where the plain was three miles long, and
three broad, and I sent people to the neighbourhood of
Zahly; but nobody knew anything of such a place,
until at last information was brought me that there
existed a plain as described in the heart of the mountain,
like a basin, and which was shut out from the
rest of the world. The book also said that a boy of
royal blood would come from distant regions, would
kiss my stirrup, and place himself under my guidance.
All this was prophesied some years ago, and I always
interpreted the bed-scene as relating to Mrs. M.
That came to pass; for, though you will not confess
it, I am sure it was so; and now the other part has
been fulfilled too.”</p>

<p>In the course of the day, Lady Hester received a
letter from Dr. Mill and Colonel Hazeta, to say that
their quarantine was over, and that they would be at
Jôon on the 1st of July.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
Sunday, July 1.—They arrived early in the morning.
After they had breakfasted, I received a note
from Dr. Mill to say that he was about to read the
morning prayers in his room, and to invite me and
any others so disposed to join him.</p>

<p>These gentlemen remained two days, but a press of
business prevented me from making memorandums.
They always went together, when Lady Hester sent
word she was ready to receive them: and this vexed
her a great deal. Dr. Mill’s profound knowledge of
languages, and his extensive reading, had given her
hopes that she might have cleared up some difficulties
respecting Eastern history, and have discussed certain
religious points about which she had not perfectly
made up her mind; but Colonel Hazeta, who was a
man of the world, and could take no part in abstruse
subjects, was a barrier to such conversation.</p>

<p>Friday, July 6.—Lady Hester was very low spirited,
and her cough troublesome. She was unable to
converse, and I left her at ten in the evening. Ali,
the messenger, had gone to Beyrout two or three days
before to carry the letter to Lord Palmerston, and to
await the arrival of the steamboat, which was expected.
His delay in returning had created great
despondency in her; and, as the air was balmy and
serene and it was a moonlight night, I sat on my
terrace, which overlooked the path by which Ali
must pass, fondly hoping that he would make his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
appearance with the long looked-for letter from Sir
Francis Burdett. Presently I heard the dogs bark,
and saw <i>Freeky</i>, the stoutest of our mastiffs, and
generally the leader, rush towards the brow of the
mountain which overlooked the valley through which
Ali must come. Their barking grew fainter, and on a
sudden ceased, and I then knew they had met some
one belonging to the household. In about a quarter
of an hour I recognized Ali, who, entering the gate,
delivered his oilskin portfolio to me, and, under a cover
to myself from the French chancellor, I found a packet
for Lady Hester. I immediately sent it to her, and
waited anxiously for the morning to learn what good
news it brought.</p>

<p>Saturday, July 7.—It was Sir Francis Burdett’s
long-expected, long-procrastinated answer, the delay
of which had caused so many wretched nights and
days to poor Lady Hester, and prevented her from
forming any settled plans. Alas! now that it was
come, it proved very unsatisfactory; yet, notwithstanding,
Lady Hester invented a thousand excuses
for him. “It is evident, doctor,” said she, “that he
could not write what he wanted to write: he wishes
me all the happiness that a mortal can share, but says
not a word that I did not know before. I have told
you that Colonel Needham left Mr. Pitt a large property
in Ireland by his will; but it so happened that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
Mr. Pitt died three days before Colonel Needham,
and consequently the death of the legatee before the
testator, in a legal point of view, put an end to the
right. I knew that as well as he did; but that was
not what I inquired about: for when Lord Kilmorey
died, to whom the property went, I supposed that, as
it was originally intended for Mr. Pitt, he might
have said, ‘As I have no children, this may as well
revert to where it was originally intended to go:—’ just
as Mrs. Coutts did not get her property from
Mr. Coutts, but with the understanding that it was
to be left afterwards to some of his grandchildren.
One time, when Lady B. was so odd in her conduct,
Mr. C. had some thoughts of making his grandson
his heir, and asked me to get him created Lord C.;
but the pride of Lord Bute, and other reasons, prevented
this.”</p>

<p>She went on. “I dare say Sir Francis was puzzled
how to act. He was afraid some of my relations
would say, ‘What business have you to interfere in
family affairs?’ and so perhaps, thinking he might get
into a duel, or some unpleasant business, he writes in
an evasive manner. But never mind! when the
<em>correspondence</em> gets into the newspapers, somebody
will be found somewhere who will know something
about the matter. Why, doctor, when Mr. Pitt died,
there were people from the bank who came to tell me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
of the money he had there, and advised me to take
it—they came twice: I suppose it was money somebody
had put in for him. But how Sir Nathaniel
Wraxall could ever get into his head that Lord C.
lent him any, I can’t imagine—a man who was so
stingy, that nothing ever was like it. No! when
Mr. Pitt went out of office, six great men subscribed a
sum to pay his debts, but Lord C. was not one of
them.”</p>

<p>Sunday, July 8.—To-day was marked by a little
fright not uncommon in these countries. Mrs. M.
was reading the morning service with the children,
when, on looking up, she observed, outside of the
window, which was open, an immense number of
sparrows making sharp cries, fluttering about the
terrace, and hovering round some object, which she
immediately perceived to be the body of a huge serpent,
hanging in one coil from the rafters of the
terrace, and suspended by the head and the tail. Sayd
Ahmed, the porter, or Black Beard, as he was usually
called from that large jet black appendage to his chin,
was known to be a deadly enemy to serpents, and my
wife had the presence of mind to say to one of the
children, “Steal gently out of the door, without
alarming the serpent, and run and call Black Beard
here directly, telling him what he is wanted for, that
he may bring some weapon with him.” John did as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
was bid, and, not finding him in the lodge, called the
first servant he saw. No less than seven ran together;
and the cook, who had seized the porter’s blunderbuss,
which was kept ready loaded on a peg, advanced to
where the serpent was yet hanging precisely in the
same position, aimed at it, and shot it through the
body. The serpent fell, and was soon killed by blows
from the bludgeons of the others. It proved, on
measurement, to be seven feet and a half long: its
colour was dark brown, somewhat mottled along the
back, and gray under the belly: and it was the largest,
excepting the boa-constrictor exhibited by T. Gully,
that I had ever seen.</p>

<p>The alarm excited by this enormous reptile was
scarcely over, when, two or three hours after sunset, a
man was seen crouching under the garden-wall, about
two hundred yards from the house; and my family,
who supposed it was a deserter, or a robber concealing
himself for some wicked purpose, informed me of it:
but, as the dogs did not bark, I knew he must be one
of the people, come there to receive stolen goods from
the maids. Probably he saw he was observed, for he
made off through the vines which grew thickly round
the place.</p>

<p>News was brought that Ibrahim Pasha had enticed
the insurgents into the plain, attacked them at a village
called <i>Yanta</i>, near the Bkâa, and killed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
wounded nearly a thousand men; for the Druzes
had no artillery, and, being undisciplined, were no
match for regular troops in an open country. The
Emir Beshýr, in the mean time, although it was
said that he had been repeatedly summoned to take
the field, was either unwilling or afraid to stir from
his palace.</p>

<p>I read out of Wraxall’s Memoirs a page or two,
which set Lady Hester talking, in her usual way,
about old times. She related several anecdotes of the
last Lord Chatham, of Lord Camden, of Lord Harrington,
and of her father, but I forbear repeating
them. “I dare say,” said she, “I have seen Sir
Nathaniel when he dined at Mr. Pitt’s; but there
came so many of them, one after another, rap, tap,
tap, rap, tap, tap! and, as soon as the last entered,
dinner was served immediately: I could not know
every body. If I had known him, I would have
made him a peer, he writes so well, and his opinions
and remarks are so just! I don’t agree with him in
one thing: the late Lord Chatham was not exactly
like his father. His nose was more pointed, and my
grandfather’s was thicker in the bone towards the top,
and with more of a bump.”</p>

<p>When Lady Hester assumed the Turkish dress,
she had her head shaved, as it is not possible to wear
the red fez and a turban in any comfort with the hair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
on. The conversation led her to speak of heads;
when, on a sudden, she pulled off her turban, fez and
all, and told me to examine her skull. Having no
precise knowledge of phrenology, I could only make
very general observations: but the examination, no
doubt, would have been an excellent study for a
craniologist. The frontal bone certainly was prominent:
but, with this exception, and a marked cavity
in the temporal bones, the skull was remarkably
smooth in carrying the hand over it, and pleasing to
the eye from its perfect form; perfect, as we should
say of a cupola that crowned an edifice with admirable
proportions.</p>

<p>She asked me, laughing, if I could see the thieving
propensity strongly marked. Then she said, “I
don’t think there are any improprieties; do say!”—“People,”
she added, “have told me the fighting
bump is as big as a lion’s:”—I felt it, but it did not
correspond with the assertion. The general appearance
was this: her head was somewhat small, her
features somewhat long; her ear was by no means
handsome, being rather large and the convolutions of
it irregular.</p>

<p>After she had put her turban on again, she observed,
“It is an erroneous opinion that a big head
always denotes much sense. I knew a countess, who
put her husband to the blush by her ignorance every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
day of her life. She would read and pore over a book,
in order to get ready something learned to say at
dinner-time, and yet was sure to make some blunder.
Thus, for example, she would be talking of a sea-fight,
and then go to ancient history, and say something
of the battle of Actium, where Scipio Africanus distinguished
himself. ‘No, my dear,’ the husband
would say, ‘you don’t mean Scipio—you forget,’
and so on. Well, this countess I recollect seeing at
Dobree’s, the hatter in Bond Street:—he made the
best beavers of any man in London, and generally
charged half a guinea more than anybody else; but he
was terribly impudent. She was trying on a beaver,
the largest in the shop, and it would not fit her; and
she was saying she must have it made larger, when
Dobree gave it a blow with his measure, and knocked
it off the counter, saying, ‘Ma’am, why, do you
think I make hats half a yard in diameter? there
ought to be no head that there hat won’t fit.’ Her
head was enormous, doctor, spreading out all round
here” (and Lady Hester put the forefinger and thumb
of each hand in a semicircle to each temple), “so she
was a pretty good proof that big heads have no
memory. Your head is the same, and you have no
memory whatever—were you always so from a
boy?... Now I have reflected, and there was
Mr. Coutts; he had a small head, but what a memory!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
and what sharpness and intelligence! Mr.
Fox’s was small in proportion to his face: Mr. Pitt’s
was neither small nor large: Lord Chatham, my
grandfather’s, was large.</p>

<p>“The fact is, as it appears to me, that size has nothing
to do with it, but all depends on the building of
the skull; just as, in the making of a cupola or a
dome, if the hemisphere is constructed in a proper
way, it will render an echo, and, if any error is made
in the arch, sound is no longer propagated in it: so, a
skull, formed in a certain way, with the brain lodged
in it, seems to give just echoes to the senses, and to
form what is called a good understanding. All depends
on construction, not size; and a little head,
well made, will have twenty times the sense of a great
one, badly built.”</p>

<p>Monday, July 9.—I went to Sayda. On my way
I passed a man on foot, raggedly dressed, evidently
weary with walking, and come from a distance: the
walking groom who was with me loitered behind, and
a recognition seemed to take place between them: they
talked together for about a quarter of an hour, and
then the groom resumed his station. “Do you know
that poor wretch?” said I: “where does he come
from?”—“He is a sort of kinsman of mine,” replied
the lad; “for he was once a farrier’s boy like myself,
and we are both nicknamed <i>el beitàr</i>: he is just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
come from Damascus, or thereabouts.”—“How?”
said I: “I thought the road was impassable.”—“So
it is,” quoth the groom; “but he was not fool enough,
I dare say, to come by the road: there are plenty of
by-paths across the country.”—“Is there no news of
the Pasha and the Druzes?” asked I. “Humph!”
said the groom; “he does not dare to tell me if there
is; but what he has let out is pretty much what was
known already. A battle has been fought at Yanta,
and things go badly.”</p>

<p>At night, on returning to the Dar, I was much surprised
to see the same pauper sitting on the mustaby
in front of the porter’s lodge. Logmagi was smoking
his <i>narkeely</i>, and, seeing me stare at the man, observed,
with a quiet air—“Here is a pretty fellow!
come to offer himself as a cook; but I think he would
hardly make a scullion: however, I suppose I must
mention it to her felicity the Syt.” I immediately
guessed the matter; he had been sent as a spy to the
camp. This was Lady Hester’s way.</p>

<p>Her ladyship had now made up her mind to execute
her threat of walling up her gateway. “You can be
no longer of any use to me,” said she to me, “and
therefore had better go as soon as you can, before the
bad weather comes on. As for my health, I am as
well, I dare say, as I shall be, and nothing that I can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
take of you European doctors will make me better; so
don’t fidget yourself on my account. All that remains
to do now is to fill up the few days you have
left in doing some necessary things for me. Let me
see—I must write to the Duke Maximilian, to Count
Wilsensheim (and you too had better write to him, or
to the baron, that they may not think you left me
unprotected; for you know how apt people are to put
bad constructions on everything)—and then there
must be a letter to Prince Pückler Muskau, and one
to Sir Francis Burdett, besides a short one to Mr.
Moore. And then you must pay the servants, and
send them away: but that we will talk about afterwards.
I shall keep none but the two boys, a man to
fetch water, the gardener, and the girls. But you
had better go to Sayda, and see about a vessel for
carrying you to Cyprus. I should not like you to sail
from Beyrout; for those people will be only bothering
you about my debts, and at present there is nothing
to be said but what has been said already. You
must send, too, for a mason to come and wall up the
gateway.”</p>

<p>Tuesday, July 10.—I did not go to Sayda to see
about a boat, for I was resolved not to leave Lady
Hester unless she insisted on it. The morning was
employed in writing the following letter to the Duke
Maximilian:—</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
<p class="right r2">
Jôon, July 10, 1838.<br>
</p>

<p class="indent2">My Lord Duke,</p>

<p>As the period of my sufferings and humiliation is
not yet over, it would be unseemly in me to draw
upon myself such an honour as you intend me in
sending your royal highness’s portrait. If it is a
proof of your friendship for me, as I flatter myself in
believing it to be, allow me, by the same title, to ask
a favour of you, which I hope you will not consider
too bold.</p>

<p>At no distant time the world will be convulsed with
extraordinary phenomena and horrible scourges, which
will bring about changes in everything: it is then
that I ask permission to address your royal highness
with that freedom I am known for, without fear of
displeasing you. Ideas bought by painful experience,
and knowledge picked up on a path covered
with thorns, may perhaps, at a crisis which will
be without example, prove useful to your royal
highness.</p>

<p>I will not recall the painful recollection of a moment
when a high fever obliged me to sacrifice the
honour and pleasure of making your personal acquaintance.</p>

<p>Be pleased, my lord duke, to accept the assurance
of my highest consideration and esteem, and my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
prayers that your royal highness will soon be restored
to the bosom of your family.</p>

<p class="right r2">
<span class="smcap">Hester Lucy Stanhope.</span><br>
</p>

<p>I send my cordial salutations to your royal highness’s
suite.</p>

<p class="p2">Monday, July 16.—I went to Beyrout to see
Monsieur Jorelle, the chancellor and chief interpreter
of the French consulate (whose lady has inspired the
pen of M. Lamartine in some beautiful lines to be
found in his <i lang="fr">Souvenirs de l’Orient</i>), in order to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
the necessary arrangements for Lady Hester’s letters,
should any come, and to acquaint him and others with
her extraordinary resolution to immure herself. I executed
her orders and delivered her message punctually;
but, I must say, I did not believe she would
put such a determination into execution. However, I
was much deceived; for, on my return to Jôon, I
found she had already employed Logmagi to hire a
boat to convey me and my family to Cyprus, seeing
I took no steps to do so myself. Now, therefore, that
her mind was made up, and knowing that, when
that was the case, nothing on earth could shake her
resolution, I employed the short space that remained
in setting her house in order, in writing her letters,
and in taking her instructions for such things as
would be useful to her in Europe.</p>

<p>I rode down to Sayda to see the vessel which
had been hired. It was a small schooner of Castel
Rosso, with a Greek crew, the most cut-throat looking
dogs I ever beheld. The passage-money had
been agreed for by Logmagi at one thousand piasters,
for a run of one hundred miles—a round sum of money
for the distance in that country, where a single
passenger often goes across in a trading-vessel for two
piasters, or about ten-pence English. The captain accompanied
me to M. Conti’s, the French agent, where
an agreement was drawn up that he was to remain in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
waiting fifteen days, at the expiration of which time,
I, (if not ready to sail,) was to pay him thirty piasters
a day for as many days as he was kept over his
time. The sinister looks of the captain made me almost
afraid to close the bargain with him. He had eyes
protruding from their sockets so far, that, when he
was arguing about the price of the passage, they stood
out just as if the cavity of the skull had been puffed
up with wind: and Lady Hester had, on some occasion,
told me that was a sign of a murderer. I recollected,
too, that it was in just such a schooner, a
few years before, four or five Europeans had been murdered
and thrown overboard in a passage from Syria
to Cyprus;<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> and, coupling these circumstances together,
I felt uneasy. It is true, the man was known
to Monsieur Conti, as having once brought a freight of
deals to Sayda; but only once. Logmagi, too, assured
me he had frequented his house at Castel Rosso;
and I was aware that, if I expressed any apprehensions
to Lady Hester Stanhope, she would call them
frivolous. I therefore signed the paper, and it was left
to be registered in the chancery, for which the fees
charged to the captain, as he told me afterwards, were
some thirty or forty piasters. I was so far right in my
conjectures about the captain’s murdering propensities,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
that, when we were on our passage, he related a story
of his having been one of the crew of a vessel which
took a Turkish ship, every one of which was butchered
in cold blood.</p>

<p>My family was made acquainted with what I had done,
and the business of packing began on the morrow.</p>

<p>The following days I was by Lady Hester’s bedside
from three to five hours every morning, and after dinner
in the saloon with her from eight or half-past eight until
twelve, one, or two o’clock. She repeated over again
many of her stories with a view of impressing them,
as I suppose, on my memory: for, having told her
one day that if she would give herself the trouble of
writing her Memoirs, she might pay her debts from
the sale of such a work, she only laughed, and said,
“Ah, well! when I get better, I shall tell you a few
more anecdotes to make a book of, since you think it
would be so profitable:” and, whenever, after dictating
a letter, I wrote it out fairly, and gave the foul copy,
together with the fair one, to her, she would take the
latter, and say, “You may keep the other:” or, if she
had reasons for wishing the contents to remain a
secret, she would take them both, and put them by
in her portfolio, and then I heard no more of the foul
copy. It was thus she sometimes told me Eastern
stories, after I had made some accidental observations
on the charm that these little stories seemed to possess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
for European readers, as was manifested in the praises
bestowed on those in M. Lamartine’s work. Had her
health been good, and had the course of events gone
on peaceably, I am inclined to think she would have
listened to my suggestion, and have dictated her
memoirs to me. On some occasions, it was her custom
to say—“Now, don’t go and write that down:” on
others, “You have kept no copy of such and such a
letter of mine,” and “You have destroyed such a
paper; give me your word:” when I was obliged to
answer categorically.</p>

<p>I was at last worn out with fatigue from long
sittings and these various occupations, not the least of
which was to put her affairs in such order, that, when
she shut herself up, she should be in want of nothing,
have nothing to pay, nothing to write, meet with no
interruptions to her seclusion, and be dead to the
world. All this I did, as far as I was able.</p>

<p>July 20.—Lady Hester dictated the following letter
to Sir Francis Burdett, in answer to the one she had
received on the 6th ultimo.</p>

</p>

<p class="indent2">My dear Burdett,</p>

<p>I am no fool, neither are you: but you might pass
for one, if in good earnest you did not understand my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
letter. You tell me what is self-evident—that I have
no right to inherit Colonel Needham’s property, &amp;c.:
neither had your daughter any right to inherit Mr.
Coutts’s property: but, in all probability, his wife,
being aware that you and your family stood high in
his estimation, paid that compliment to his memory.
Lord Kilmorey, who had no children, being aware of
General Needham’s partiality towards Mr. Pitt, might,
by his will, have allowed the property to return to the
remaining branch of the Pitt family. Do not be afraid
that I am going to give you any fresh trouble about
this affair, notwithstanding I believe that you were
some time hatching this stupid answer; but I do not
owe you any grudge, as I know that it does not come
from you:—I know where it comes from.</p>

<p>A lion of the desert, being caught in the huntsman’s
net, called in vain to the beasts of the field to assist
him, and received from them about as shuffling an
answer as I have received from you, and previously
from Lord H********. A little field mouse gnawed
the master-knot, and called to the lion to make a great
effort, which burst the noose, and out came the lion
stronger than ever.</p>

<p>I am now about building up every avenue to my
premises, and there shall wait with patience, immured
within the walls, till it please God to send me a little
mouse: and whoever presumes to force my retirement,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
by scaling my walls or anything of the like, will be
received by me as Lord Camelford would have received
them.</p>

<p>Tuesday, July 24.—Her ladyship dictated another
letter to Count Wilsensheim. It was written in French,
like all those addressed to foreigners, but which have
all been given translated: for the style of Lady
Hester’s French was composed of Anglicisms, and, in
turning them into her native tongue, the very expressions
which she would have used seemed naturally to
present themselves.</p>


<p class="p2 center">
<i>Lady Hester Stanhope to Count Wilsensheim, Chamberlain<br>
to His Imperial Majesty, &amp;c. &amp;c.</i><br>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right r2">
Jôon, June 24, 1838.<br>
</p>

<p class="indent2">Sir Count,</p>

<p>I have delayed answering your amiable letter until
I thought your voyage was over. I am happy that
his Royal Highness quitted this country when he did;
not because of the plague—the season was gone by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
this year for that—but because of the aspect of affairs,
and of the Druze insurrection, which has grown considerably
hotter, and which would have made it
impossible to travel with any comfort.</p>

<p>Ibrahim Pasha began the war in the Horàn with
forty-five thousand men; the Druzes had but seven
thousand, assisted by some tribes of the Arabs of the
Desert. Ibrahim Pasha has lost thirty thousand,
between Nizàm troops (as they are called), Sugmans,
and Albanians, without reckoning the wounded. The
Druze army, I believe, does not at present exceed two
thousand five hundred men: but each man of that
two thousand five hundred is singly worth twenty.
The last seat of the war was about fourteen leagues
distant in a strait line from my residence. The
Druzes, after having well beaten Ibrahim Pasha and
killed some of his officers, retreated to the Horàn,
pursued by the Pasha.</p>

<p>You no doubt are aware that his Highness the
Pasha, in concert with the Emir Beshýr, disarmed the
Druzes some time ago by a stratagem, which gave the
government means to take their sons as conscripts for
the <i>nizàm</i>. After that, they, in like manner, disarmed
the Christians: but necessity has compelled
the pasha lately to give them their arms again, in
order to enable the son of the Emir Beshýr to join
the pasha’s forces with a reinforcement of Christians,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
which he stood in need of to garrison the skirts of the
mountain on the side of the Bkâa. The Druzes killed
a great many of these Christians, and they could have
annihilated them: but they said to them, “You are
not to blame: it goes against us to exterminate you,
for we have always lived with you on friendly terms;
but we will slay without pity every Christian we find
in arms, excepting those of the mountain.”</p>

<p>The French government has done an imprudent
thing in removing Mr. Consul Guys from his post at
Beyrout; because that gentleman had very extensive
connexions amongst the bishops and priests, and all
the numerous sects of Christians found on Mount
Lebanon; and, by his information and experience,
had means of giving them good advice. For, if by
chance those Christians gave heed to bad counsel, it
might not be impossible that half the Franks who
inhabit this country would be massacred by the
Nabloosians, the Druzes, the Ansaréas, the Ishmäelites,
the Shemsíahs, the Kelbías, and the Koords in general,
who occupy the country between Mount Lebanon and
Aleppo on the side of Gebel el Segaun, not far from
Antioch.</p>

<p>As I know how to speak no language but that of
the Orientals, you will forgive me, Sir Count, if I
call you the Pope’s Grand Vizir. It devolves, therefore,
on you to think of a way to make Monsieur Guys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
return to the post which he has just quitted:—a
thing, in my opinion, very necessary both for the
safety of the country, and of the Europeans in it. I
have a great esteem for Monsieur Guys, but I see him
so seldom, that, whether he is far or near, it is pretty
much the same to me. As for the Christians here, I
do not interest myself more about them than about
other men—perhaps less; not on account of their
religion, but of their qualities, of which egotism and
perfidy are marked characteristics in most of them.
As a religion is with me neither more nor less than a
costume of adoration, it is all one whether it is green,
white, blue, or black. To me it is all the same whether
a man prostrates himself before a piece of wood, or
before a cockle-shell, as the Metoualis do, provided his
heart addresses itself to the Almighty.</p>

<p>Perhaps for saying this, you will have me crucified
by the Pope: never mind—if it is my lot, I shall not
repine; since, whatever is decreed must necessarily
happen: but it is not necessary, for all that, by a
want of policy, to make civil wars break out, which
would do no good to anybody, and which would not
turn to any account, even for those who stirred them
up: neither is it proper to remove those to a distance,
who have the means of pacifying the disputants, should
the case require it.</p>

<p>If I had had the happiness of seeing you, I would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
have asked you if you had ever seen the prophecy of a
certain Pope, whose leaden coffin was found about
seventy years ago: that prophecy has great analogy
with some Oriental ones.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Lady Hester wished me also to write to the count,
to let him know how it happened that Prince Pückler
Muskau had been entrusted with the correspondence
between herself, Lord Palmerston, his grace the Duke
of Wellington, &amp;c., &amp;c.,: and also, as much had been
said of the prince’s way of travelling at the expense
of Mahomet Ali Pasha, to assure him, the count, that
the prince showed no signs of stinginess when at Jôon.
The next day, being Wednesday, when I could not
see Lady Hester, I executed her wish.</p>

<i>Dr. M. to Count Wilsensheim.</i><br>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right r2">
Jôon, July 25, 1838.<br>
</p>

<p class="indent2">Sir Count,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>As you appear to take a lively interest in whatever
regards Lady Hester Stanhope, I hope, on that account,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
you will excuse me, if I join to her ladyship’s
letter a few words from myself, to place in their true
light some circumstances which might otherwise appear
extraordinary to you.</p>

<p>In consequence of the proceedings instituted against
her ladyship by the English government, Lady Hester
has resolved to shut herself up in her house, to wall
up the entrance, and to bury herself, as one would
say, in a tomb, until those, who have attempted to
cast a stain on her integrity (the rightful inheritance,
as she affirms, of the Pitt family), shall, by a signal
reparation, have washed it out. She is in the act of
reducing her establishment to her strict wants by
discharging her servants. I myself am on the point of
my departure for Europe, forced by her ladyship to go,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
but deeply regretting that I must leave her without a
single European near her person, and without a single
servant in whom she has confidence. My uneasiness,
however, does not extend so far as to fear for her personal
safety, although the war between the Druzes and the
Pasha rages more fiercely than ever: because I know
the firmness and intrepidity of her character, the
resources of her mind, and the respect and dread in
which the two hostile parties hold her.</p>

<p>It is probable that her ladyship’s grievances will
find their way into the public papers; for Prince
Pückler Muskau, when on his visit here, was so struck
with the indignities of which she continued to be the
victim, that he was resolved to give some true details
of it to the public. Her ladyship had found in him
a man at once intelligent and kind; ready indeed
to offer her his assistance to a greater extent than
she was willing to accept in everything relative to
her affairs.</p>

<p>It is very extraordinary that, at that time, Lady
Hester knew nothing of the avarice imputed to him,
of which it was impossible she could have the least
suspicion; for his stay at her house was marked by a
degree of liberality in everything befitting a prince,
and absolutely at variance with the reports spread
about him in the places through which he has passed—reports,
which astonished her ladyship as much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
as they did me, since nothing of the kind was seen
here.</p>

<p>Thank God! I leave her in better health, and lively
as always, just as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p class="right r2">
<span style="margin-right: 2.5em;">I have the honour to be, Sir Count,</span><br>
<span style="margin-right: 0.5em;">Your most obedient humble servant,</span><br>
——<br>
</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Sunday, July 29.—The last letter which Lady
Hester wrote before I left her was the following, to
Charles Baron de Busech:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right r2">
Jôon, July 29, 1838.<br>
</p>

<p class="indent2">Sir Baron,</p>

<p>Mortified as I was that circumstances prevented me
from felicitating you in person on the re-establishment
of your health, I am nevertheless rejoiced that you
all hastened to quit Syria, seeing that the warfare
between Ibrahim Pasha and the Druzes has become
exceeding rancorous, and would have made travelling
through the country far from agreeable. The scene of
action has lately been at Rashéyah, where the Druzes
have performed miracles. The Emir Beshýr’s son
marched with a reinforcement to assist Ibrahim Pasha,
and of this the Druzes killed just enough in the
twinkling of an eye to convince the whole body that,
if they, the Druzes, had not chosen to recollect they
were fighting with neighbours, they could have exterminated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
them. The Emir’s son had his horse killed
under him, and that prince took refuge very quickly
in the mountain.</p>

<p>When the Druzes found out that the Pasha’s
artillery in the valleys cut them up dreadfully, and
that personal courage was of no value, they retreated
to the Horàn, where the inequality of the ground was
more favourable to them. At this moment, Ibrahim
Pasha is in pursuit of them, and has given orders to
his Bedouin robbers, whom he brought from Egypt
(a tribe which is called the Hanâdy), to run down the
greatest hero the Druzes have got, and to bring him
alive; being so struck with the courage of the man,
that he would willingly employ him in his own service.
Poor Pasha! I fancy he has made a bad
calculation, in thinking that one of the family of
Arriàn, men accustomed like their ancestors to rule
with sovereign authority in their castle at Gendal,
would ever become a vile slave to save his wife. Shibly
el Arriàn is not only a hero in battle but a Demosthenes
in council: he makes even the great tremble
by the language he holds.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
An order has just been issued by the Emir Beshýr
to search the dwellings of the Druzes afresh for concealed
arms, and to take from them their horses: this
is, at best, a great piece of imprudence, because, seeing
that many of the cavaliers would sooner fly than give
up their horses, he will thus increase the number of
insurgents in the Horàn. Ibrahim Pasha with the
wreck of his army, of which he has lost full thirty
thousand without counting the wounded, cannot, if he
does not soon make peace and come to some composition,
do much more with the Druzes.</p>

<p>This is the state of affairs at this present moment;
but it is difficult to get at the truth. Even your
friend L., if he knows anything, dares not avow it:
but what such sort of people know is so little—their
information is so confined—they are all so ignorant of
the true character, of the projects, and of the resources
of the different races that inhabit Syria—that the
reasonings they make are about as false as a fairy tale.</p>

<p class="right r2">
<span style="margin-right: 2.5em;">I have the honour to be, Sir Baron,</span><br>
<span style="margin-right: 0.5em;">With all esteem and consideration,</span><br>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Monday, July 30.—The mason had been sent for
from Sayda, and stones and materials had been collected
for walling-up the gateway. Lady Hester<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
drew out on paper the exact manner in which she
wished it to be done. It was a screen, which completely
masked the gateway, and left a side opening
just large enough for a cow or an ass laden with
water to enter. I superintended this work of self-inhumation,
the like of which never entered woman’s
mind before. It was an affair of two days, Monday
and Tuesday.</p>

<p>Tuesday, July 31.—To-day, I spoke to Lady Hester
medically for the last time. Her pulse had recovered
much of its wonted strength, and although there were
periods when she coughed violently, still the struggles
of a naturally good constitution and powerful lungs
had enabled her to hold out against the most formidable
attack of pulmonary catarrh that I had ever
seen a human being withstand.</p>

<p>Thursday, August 2.—As no letters came from
Prince Pückler Muskau, and as it was evident some
reason had prevented him from fulfilling his promise of
publishing Lady Hester’s correspondence, she now
gave me her final instructions on that head. I am
disposed to believe it was the strong desire that possessed
her to ensure the publication of her letters in
the newspapers, which, amidst much hesitation and
wavering, made her decide on my departure; for she
knew she could rely on me, and the publicity of her
grievances now seemed to be the paramount object in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
thoughts. Her anxiety on this point was so great
that, lest any accident might happen to the MS. by
shipwreck or otherwise, she had a second copy made
of the whole correspondence, which was to be left with
her, whilst I retained the originals.</p>

<p>Her own conviction was that her constitution was
invulnerable—she thought she should yet live to see
her enemies confounded, the Sultan triumphant, her
debts paid, and an ample income at her disposal. She
dwelt with the same apparent confidence as ever on
the approaching advent of the Mehedi, and still looked
on her mare, Leila, as destined to bear him, with
herself on Lûlû by his side. “I shall not die in my
bed,” she would say, “and I had rather not; my
brother did not, and I have always had a feeling that
my end would be in blood: that does not frighten me
in the least.”</p>

<p>From August the 1st until the 6th, I was too much
employed to take notes. On the fourth, the fifteen
days agreed on with the captain were at an end, and
he became importunate for our departure. But, now
that the moment of separation had arrived, Lady
Hester had some misgivings, and seemed to wish to
defer it: I accordingly paid a first day’s forfeit, then
a second, then a third. At last, however, on Monday,
August the 6th, 1838, I took an affectionate leave of
her, and never saw her more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
On quitting her I said—“It is better that I should
not see you to-morrow, even though I should not set
off early.”—“You do right,” she replied: “let this
be our parting.”—“But you have no money,” I observed:
“how will you do for your current expenses?”—“It’s
true,” she answered; “I must thank you to
lend me 2000 piasters before you go, and I’ll repay
you as soon as I can: send them in by Ibrahim—he’s
an honest lad, and, even if he knew it was money,
would not touch it. But, however, you had better
put two or three things of no value in a little basket,
and a cup and saucer, or something that weighs, as if
you sent them for my use, and then the gold will lie
underneath unsuspected.” This was done, and I
would have sent more (for I had twice as much more
by me), but when I proposed to do so her ladyship
objected—remarking, “You may be blown out of
your course, and be obliged to remain days and days
at some port where you may want it for the necessaries
of life. Two thousand will do, and, if I want
more, Logmagi, I am sure, will raise me as much.”</p>

<p>August 7.—It was eleven in the day before we
could get everything ready. As we quitted the terrace,
where we had passed nearly fifteen months, my wife
and daughter shed tears. The black girl, Zezefôon,
was seen looking after us from the garden-wall, where
she, or the other maids, had kept watch from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
dawn. Our servants walked by our side to Sayda,
and the secretary accompanied us.</p>

<p>When we were about two miles on the road, a
servant was descried running after us. My heart
beat—I knew not what might have happened: but
his business was merely to deliver a bag he had on
his shoulders, in which was a small Turkey carpet for
spreading on the cabin-floor in the vessel: this Lady
Hester had sent, with a message that perhaps we
might find it serviceable in the passage. Even to
the last moment did her kind consideration for our
comforts manifest itself.</p>

<p>We embarked under the escort of Logmagi, amidst
a crowd of persons who had collected on the strand.
On board we found the entire hold neatly partitioned
off by mats, which had been done by Logmagi’s care,
and mats spread on the ballast; so that we had
spacious and convenient berths for all the party.
The schooner was fir-built, and quite new: whether
this was the reason that she abounded in cockroaches
I know not, or whether it was the extreme heat or
her cargo that had introduced them; but there were
thousands and thousands crawling in every direction,
and this annoyance, added to the burning sun, made
the passage far from pleasant. Our captain was named
Kyriaco Candevíti, and the vessel the Thrasybulus.
On Friday at sunset we anchored in Cyprus roads, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
on Saturday morning were received on the seashore by
our excellent and generous friend, Signor Baldassare
Mattei, at the door of his marine villa, into which he
ushered us, and, in the true spirit of Eastern hospitality,
made himself our guest, and insisted on it
that we were from that moment in our own mansion.
It was the same house we had inhabited in 1832.</p>

<p>We remained in Cyprus three weeks, delighted with
the kindness of the Europeans and natives, and revelling
in the abundance for which that happy island is
so famous. We were luxuriously supplied with sweet
and water melons, grapes, figs, pomegranates, and
other fruits, of a flavour and size passing belief.
Partridges were at 2½<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> each, hares at <a id="chg6"></a>6<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>, a loaf of
bread of the size of a quart basin at 1½<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>, mutton at
2<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> a pound, a fine hen for 5<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>, and so in proportion
of other things, with the exception of fish, which was
rather dear.</p>

<p>Finding here the same vessel that had carried us to
Europe in 1832 and still commanded by the same
master, we took our passage by her for 1000 frs. board
included, and on the 30th of August set sail. Our
voyage was prosperous, and, reaching the port of
Marseilles on the 7th of October, we disembarked on
the 8th in the afternoon, and entered the lazaretto,
where we performed quarantine for fifteen days. Then,
resting ourselves for a week in a hotel at Marseilles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
during which time I transmitted a copy of the correspondence
to England to be inserted in the newspapers,
and, leaving Miss Longchamps with her friends, we
betook ourselves to Nice, where we arrived on the
2nd of November, having been absent a little more
than seventeen months. In mentioning the name of
Mademoiselle Longchamps for the last time, I must,
even at the risk of offending her extreme delicacy,
bear testimony to her amiable cheerfulness of character
under all our difficulties, to her rare conversational
powers, her exemplary but unobtrusive piety, and
those numberless good qualities, which a close acquaintance
under trying circumstances gave us such
peculiar opportunities of discovering.</p>

<p>After my arrival at Nice, I received letters
from Lady Hester about once a month, up to the
time of her death. The first was dated September
30, 1838.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="indent2">Dear Doctor,</p>

<p>I cannot answer to-night the letters I have just
received from you (from Cyprus), but must say two
words to clear up what, to anybody but yourself, would
appear but too extraordinary. The messenger, sent by
Monsieur Jorelle, arrived at the moment my dinner
was set before me: I looked at the direction of the
letters, and gave them to Zezefôon to put by in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
same room until I had dined. When I wanted them,
one of yours was not to be found; and she turned the
room upside down, always with her usual impudence
asking if she ate letters, &amp;c.;—you know what beasts
they all are. It cannot be lost; but where she has
stuffed it God knows! Yesterday she lost a piece of
fine cloth in the same way, which is not yet found:—to-morrow
something else. You know them but too
well, and also their impudent conduct, when they find
they are in the wrong.</p>

<p>The prince is gone to Europe. I hope soon to hear
of your safe arrival in France, and I shall write to
you by the next Vapour.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p class="indent2">Dear Doctor,</p>

<p>I hope soon to hear of your safe arrival at Marseilles,
and take the first opportunity of repaying you
the 2,000 piasters, for the loan of which I am very
much obliged to you. I enclose a bill on Coutts for
£50—twenty for you and thirty for commissions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
What I immediately want (and, supposing you are
at Nice, if procured by your friend, Captain Pardoe,
will be better, as he understands these things), is—</p>

<p>Some dried cherries and Burgundy apricots, simply
dried like raisins, if such are to be had at Marseilles,
eight or ten pounds of each;</p>

<p>Small covered pans for milk;</p>

<p>Three wire blinds for the milk-room, fine, that flies
cannot enter, each three spans square, or about half
an ell;</p>

<p>Some wire covers for the milk-pans;</p>

<p>Pots and jugs of different sizes;</p>

<p>A supply of yellow and red earthenware.</p>

<p>I forgot to ask you, when you were here, if there
were kettles in iron like tin ones, and coffee-pots: for
they would be of great use, as tin is destroyed in a
day, and a large boiler would stand better on the fire
than a tin kettle—for always, I mean—and better for
my kitchen: better also for the milkboy, to wash up
his pots and pans. I want too some iron spoons, and
some wooden ladles and skimmers.</p>

<p>I should like to have Miss Pardoe’s book on Constantinople,
if it is come out, for strangers; for, I fear,
I never could get through with it myself, no more
than the others you have sent me; but I must trust
to chance. This just puts me in mind that one of
the books I should like to have would be Graham’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
Domestic Medicine—a good Red Book (Peerage, I
mean)—and the book about the Prince of Wales,
George the Fourth.</p>

<p>I have found out a person who can occasionally
read French to me: so, if there was any very pleasing
French book, you might send it—but no Bonapartes,
&amp;c., or “present times”—and a little <i lang="fr">brochure</i>
or two upon baking, pastry, gardening, &amp;c.:—some
haricot seeds, and also dahlias of different colours.</p>

<p>Are there no iron candlesticks for lamps, for the servants
to work by at night? for my new people shall
work like other servants: besides, in out-of-door
rooms, there are no lamps to see by, and those thick
glass globes, with two or three burners, would be useful.
Add, also, some inkstands of thick glass, with
a tray of tin or japan, like a coffee-tray.</p>

<p>I should think it right of you to send a line of
certificate to Lord H., in case he should want it, just
saying, “I have had a letter from Lady Hester Stanhope,
in which she requests me to give your lordship,
in writing, my opinion of her health,” &amp;c.; then the
essence of the said certificate to be (if you think so)
“that, having known Lady Hester nearly thirty years,
I can safely say that I never have yet seen such a
constitution; that the most severe illnesses often have
not appeared to attack or impair the stamina of it;
that,” &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
I have had a very kind letter from the Prince
[Pückler Muskau]; he is gone to Europe, or, at least,
is on his way: his slaves, &amp;c., went by Leghorn. He
says, there were difficulties respecting the Queen’s
letter in Germany; but he has another plan. He
desires to be kindly remembered to you.</p>

<p>If I inquire about your health, or that of your
family, it will be in my own way, with interest, and
perhaps giving some opinion, which, as usual, may be
taken ill: so I shall say nothing, either now or hereafter,
on that subject. I strained my eyes to write a
long letter, now before me, about your complaint on
the chest; but I shall burn it. Everybody is laid up
here; Logmagi with a bad fever, as also Mustafa and
the cowboy; Mohammed with a fit of the gout, unable
to walk or stir: Fatôom, half with whims, always
under the coverlet; Zezefôon ill, but keeping to her
work. The early rain has caused illness everywhere.</p>

<p>Arriàn’s troops being so diminished, and his resources
failing, owing to want of assistance from the
other Druzes, who hung back after Ibrahim Pasha’s
declaration that he would burn all Druze property in
the mountain, he has surrendered, they say severely
wounded by the Arabs of his party for being a traitor
in their eyes. Affairs are, therefore, a little quiet in
that quarter for the present; but, towards Aleppo, the
Kûrds and Turkmans are very troublesome, and every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
one seems alarmed. Corn has risen to a terrible price,
and barley there is none: though some, they say, has
been brought to Beyrout.</p>

<p>Twenty-five thousand purses have been found with
the cheating Yazjees,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> who are in a sad position.
Four or five hundred families will be implicated in
this business, and ruined by their want of honesty.
The mountain is in a very disturbed state; but my
habitation is well walled in, and the weight of all on
poor me; for Logmagi is at Sayda. No letters from
England.</p>

<p>So far till to-day; afterwards I shall not be able
to give you any account of myself, as I suffer so by
writing. The spectacles always cause me such a vast
pain, that I cannot stand it: and, besides, it lasts all
day, or next day. I was going to say, pray save your
eyes, and do not read so much useless trash: but I
forgot—I will never give you any more advice.</p>

<p>Mr. M., whom you did not see at Cyprus, has
offered to serve me as secretary and to arrange my
servants, he living at his own expense at Jôon or some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
other village; but, as he refused all salary, I could
not do otherwise than refuse his offer.</p>

<p>This is my last long letter.</p>

<p class="right r2">
Jôon, February 9, 1839.<br>
</p>

<p>You need not tremble this time, my dear doctor,
for I am not displeased with you. The “Sir William
Knighton”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> is not worth looking into, and “Love”
is not amongst them. The book of medicine is clear
and well written.</p>

<p>I have to thank you for a vast deal of trouble you
have given yourself: all in the end will turn out well,
I hope. I have written a few lines in answer to the
“Morning Chronicle,” which you will afterwards see
in “Galignani,” without doubt.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>What a simpleton you are sometimes! Leave my
systems to me, and adopt those of your own; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
don’t blame mine, as you have done, without knowing
the reason of them.</p>

<p>Miss Pardoe’s book I have not yet looked into.
The one<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> you sent me is interesting only to those
who were acquainted with the persons named:—all
mock taste, mock feeling, &amp;c.; but that is the fashion.
“I am this—I am that:” who ever talked such empty
stuff formerly? <em>I</em> was never named by a well-bred
person.</p>

<p>There has been a vast deal of rain this year; but
not very cold: the house nearly as usual. My cough
continues—my spirits the same.</p>

<p>A hyena came into the garden the other day, and
Ibrahim Beytàr killed it with only a bludgeon, and
brought me the skin: it is the first wild beast of the
kind that has been so daring this winter. The dogs
frightened the animal so much on the outside that it
scaled the wall.</p>

<p>Let me hear when you leave Nice. I should think
England would be a very unpleasant <i lang="fr">séjour</i> in the
present state of affairs; Switzerland, perhaps, more
healthy, cheaper, and more agreeable, until you see
distinctly the turn things take and my affairs settled.
You do not mention your health; therefore, I hope it
is not to be complained of at this moment.</p>

<p>Shut up, as I am, I can have no news:—advice you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
take ill, and call it scolding. I am too much obliged
to Captain Pardoe for having undertaken my commissions.
I have safely received the stockings you had
the attention to send me. * * * *</p>

<p>You must promise to state to me fairly the impression
my affairs make with the English, and what sort,
what class of English.</p>

<p>Arriàn has been bribed, and is now raising a regiment
of two thousand for Ibrahim Pasha. There will
be hard work here ere long. It appears the <i>kurkuby</i>
[uproar] about money was certainly the disgusting
examination into the private affairs of officers in the
navy at the Admiralty, and of the army at the Horse
Guards: it has disgusted every one, and roused a feeling
about me.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right r2">
Jôon, March 11, 1839.<br>
</p>

<p>I send you something to get put into a newspaper:
I think it is not bad. Some day, I shall write a
<i>manifesto</i>, which will be superb, and open people’s eyes
in all directions. * * * * *</p>

<p>I would have sent you Sir William Knighton’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
work; but I suppose you can get it where you are,
and it would not amuse you: it speaks of nothing but
common-place things. He has kept only—or, at least,
they have published only—formal letters, and which
throw little light on anything.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Miss Pardoe is very excellent upon many subjects;
only there is too much of what the English like—stars,
winds, black shades, soft sounds, &amp;c. The
Arabic story you ask me for, I have already dictated
to the prince. I know many others; but they are too
long. Are you going to write a book?</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I believe your eyes and ears will be opened too late.
You will then see, to your cost, that admonitions
(called scoldings) were the highest compliment I could
pay a man in your situation, by endeavouring to raise
his mind to the altitude necessary to exist (one may
say) in a wreck of worlds. If you were so uneasy at
Jôon, how will your nerves bear what you will be
doomed to see? but, when this time comes, no more
advice from me to you or any one: let all pick their
way, and abide by the consequences. Words are
nothing: the hearts of men must be cleansed of all
the vain idle stuff they now cherish as a sort of safeguard
or escape-boat to evils of all kind. If the naked
savage, who has the feelings of a man, is not in high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
favour with the Almighty, and placed in a higher situation
(if he continues to do his duty) than the educated
mylord, the pedant, the gentleman, as it is called,
without either conscience, talent, or money, I know
nothing; and you may reproach me hereafter in the
harshest possible terms.</p>

<p>It is a very mean spirit which fears obligation: we
are under obligations of the most serious nature every
day to the horse, the ass, the cow, &amp;c. All the stuff
persons now call spirit are the vulgar ideas of the
lowest and least philosophical of human beings. What
should I think of my deserted self, were I to constantly
talk to Logmagi of obligation? I am proud to acknowledge
all I owe to his zeal and obedience.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I am contented with the violence of my own character:
it draws a line for me between friends and
enemies.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There is at this moment a great <i>kirkuby</i> [uproar or
disturbance,]—seizing recruits for the <i>nizàm</i>, and
entering by force into all sorts of houses to seek for
arms.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Will you see that I receive a dozen pair of spectacles
like those you wear, six or seven of fine quality, and
the others common black ones but with clear glasses:
and a dozen like what I wear—not expensive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
Always employ me if I can be useful to you here.
I expect to hear from you. When do you think of
leaving Nice? My affair will not finish quickly, I am
afraid. Your friend U. will get on: he is all information,
energy, and talent; but the times are gone by
for people to go the beaten track, and all is too late.
In less than a year, it is more than probable that all
the world will be at war.</p>

<p>The Prophet [General Loustaunau] is most comfortable
in his new habitation: I have planted shrubs
for him round the windows, divided the room in two,
and made all new with an excellent sofa.</p>

<p>I must tell you a story about Logmagi. He was
reproaching one of the <i>mukers</i> [muleteers] about some
neglect of his duty—only abusing him, never touching
him—when the fellow ran and fetched his pistol, which
he presented at Logmagi to shoot him. Logmagi,
with a wonderful presence of mind, vulgar perhaps,
(but every one in his way—the <i>muker</i> was a vulgar
man), turned into his face not his own face, and said—“No
honest man would meet a blackguard face to face—that
was his <i>khurge</i>” [match]. The bystanders roared
with laughter, and the man ran away.</p>

<p>Quickly, by the steamer, the spectacles. Seven pair
of white ones, long; five others, long too, but like
those you wear, black and light.</p>

</p>

<p>The Vapour is expected in a few days. I am much
better, but not yet well enough to make a little drawing,
necessary to explain something I want you to get
done for me. * * * * *</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Thank God for my nerves:—would you sleep alone in
a room with this girl [Zezefoon]? And, besides she
told me, the other day, that she had only teeth for
those who displeased her, and therefore you see she is
not ashamed of herself: but I think no more of her
than of a little babe, and sleep on quietly. All in the
house have made wry faces after this affair—even
Logmagi, who would not like to be bitten a second
time.</p>

<p>I did not write to you before I had answered the
“Morning Chronicle;” for I feared that perhaps my
letter to you might be read, and so spoil all.</p>

<p>As yet, all things remain as before: what strange
people! No answer from any one. Not one Englishman
has set his foot in Syria since this business.</p>

<p>Some one—I suppose you—sent me the “Life of
Lord Edward Fitzgerald.” It is <em>I</em> who could give a
true and most extraordinary history of all those transactions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
The book is all stuff. The duchess (Lord
Edward’s mother) was my particular friend, as was
also his aunt: I was intimate with all the family, and
knew that noted Pamela. All the books I see make
me sick—only catch-penny nonsense.</p>

<p>A thousand thanks for the promise of my grandfather’s
letters; but the book will be all spoilt, by
being edited by young men. First, they are totally
ignorant of the politics of my grandfather’s age;
secondly, of the style of the language used at that
period; and absolutely ignorant of his secret reasons
and intentions, and the <em>real</em>, or apparent footing he was
upon with many people, friends and foes. I know all
that from my grandmother, who was his secretary,
and, Coutts used to say, the cleverest <em>man</em> of her time,
in politics, business, &amp;c. Even the late Lord Chatham,
his son, had but an imperfect idea of all that took place;
for he was either absent, or, when not so, taken up by
dissipation; for no man was ever more admired or
sought after. Pringle’s father, I suppose, is dead, and
this is the son—Harriet Elliott’s son. At twenty, she
married an officer, nearly fifty, I should think * *
but who was, I believe, a very honourable, respectable
man.</p>

<p>Do not keep reproaching yourself about leaving me;
it did not depend on you to stay: also, do not put
into your head that you have the seeds of the malady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
you named to me. * * * * I hope
to hear that you are better.</p>

<p class="right r2">

</p>

<p>I have written a sad, stupid letter, but I have no
news—shut up.</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb">

<p>This was the last letter I ever received from her
ladyship. She died in June following, <ins title="Hataphos, haklautos, haphilos, anymenaios,">Ἄταφος, ἄκλαυτος, ἄφιλος, ἀνυμεναιος</ins><a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> everybody being in ignorance of her
approaching end, except the servants immediately
about her. She had no Frank or European near her,
and Lunardi, who was coming out to her from Leghorn,
reached Beyrout unfortunately too late. “The news<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
of her death was conveyed to Beyrout in a few hours,
and the English consul, Mr. Moore, and the Rev. Mr.
Thomson, an American missionary, went to Jôon, to
bury her. Her emaciated corpse was interred in the
same grave where the body of Captain Loustaunau had
been placed, some years before, in her own garden:
this was according to her desire, expressed to Logmagi
before her death.” Reports were spread that her furniture,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
plate, and other valuables, had been plundered,
and much stress was laid on the circumstance that not
even her watch was found: but she had no watch,
and only a dozen and a half of silver spoons and
forks. Fatôom, it is said, died two days before her
mistress.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I have now brought this melancholy, but, I hope,
not uninteresting, narrative to a conclusion. Upon
a review of the incidents detailed in these pages—the
vicissitudes of an extraordinary life, beginning in
pomp and power, and closing in pecuniary difficulties
and neglect—the reader can scarcely fail to be touched
with profound sympathy at the altered fortunes of a
remarkable woman, even if nothing else in the history
of Lady Hester Stanhope should awaken his emotions.
No lady of her age and station ever underwent such
afflicting changes.</p>

<p>In early life she enjoyed the entire confidence of
her uncle, Mr. Pitt; and many of the secret functions
of government, most of the important measures of his
administration, much of the patronage vested in the
office which he filled, and the complete control of his
domestic establishment, either passed through her
hands or was directly influenced by her counsels.
During this eventful period, her clear insight into
human nature enabled her frequently to thwart the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
intrigues and expose the designs of interested men,
who swarmed about the avenues of the court and the
cabinet. But it was not possible for one, endued with
a courageous spirit and integrity like hers, to engage in
such conspicuous scenes without exciting the bitterest
animosities; and accordingly we find that, while she
was openly hostile to some and maintained a less evident
but persevering resistance to others, dealing out
affronts where she thought them likely to tell with
effect, or foiling subtile machinations on the one hand
by counterplots artfully combined on the other, she
raised up a host of enemies for herself, who only
waited a fit opportunity to take their full revenge.
In the assertion of that fearless rectitude which despises
personal consequences, she overlooked the
dangers which were growing up around her. Forgetting,
as is usual, in the delirium of power, the
uncertainty of all human greatness, the wheel of fortune
went round, and, by the premature death of Mr.
Pitt, she was precipitated, at once and irrecoverably,
from the pinnacle of ambition into comparative obscurity,
and was destined to wear out her existence in
solitude and exile.</p>

<p>But her virtues were sterling, and gave a sort of
lustre to her fall. She carried with her into exile and
in adversity the same stern consistency and the same
high principles which had all along regulated her conduct.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
Incapable of abasing herself by meanness, she
was sustained in her reverses by the fortitude which she
derived from a clear conscience. If in her exaltation she
had been bold, proud, and uncompromising, she had likewise
shown herself disinterested and generous, firm in
her convictions, insensible to the allurements of flattery
or wealth, just, self-devoted, an open foe, a grateful
friend, and a kind and most affectionate relative:—qualities
which ennoble even where nobility is not.
Caressed by royalty, surrounded by sycophants, a
theme for the illustrations of poetry and painting, she
resisted all those blandishments so alluring and so difficult
to withstand, and has not left behind her one
single memorial of any of the weaknesses incidental to
human vanity under circumstances of such powerful
temptation. No prince led her in his train; no mercenary
laureat succeeded in bribing her by his praises;
and no portrait of her person, attractive as it might
have been in the bloom of her youth and beauty,
is, as far as I have means of knowing, in existence.
The good old king extolled her, Mr. Pitt confided in
her, the aristocratic party toadied her, republicans
admired her, and ladies envied her. Never was an
elevation so dazzling, or a fall so clouded by the
gloom of disappointment and neglect.</p>

<p>But there is yet a moral to be drawn from her life
which is pregnant with serious reflections. That she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
was more unhappy in her solitude than, in her unbending
nature, she would stoop to avow, this diary
of the last years of her existence but too plainly
demonstrates. Although she derived consolation in
retirement from the retrospect of the part she had
played in her prosperity, yet her mind was embittered
by some undefined but acute sense of past errors;
and, although her buoyant spirits usually bore her up
against the weight by which she was oppressed, still
there were moments of poignant grief when all efforts
at resistance were vain, and her very soul groaned
within her. She was ambitious, and her ambition had
been foiled; she loved irresponsible command, but the
time had come when those over whom she had ruled
defied her; she was dictatorial and exacting, but she
had lost the talisman<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> of that influence which alone
makes people tolerate control, when it interferes with
the freedom of thought and action. She had neglected
to secure wealth while she had it in her power; but
the feelings which prompted her princely munificence
were as warm as ever, now that the means
were gone which enabled her to gratify them. Her
mind was in a perpetual struggle between delusive
schemes and incompetent resources. She incurred
debts, and she was doomed to feel the degradation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
consequent on them. She entertained visionary
projects of aggrandizement, and was met by the
derision of the world. She spurned the conventional
rules of that society in which she had been bred,
and perhaps violated propriety in the realization
of a singularity in which she gloried. <em>There</em> was the
rock on which she was finally wrecked: for, as
Madame de Staël somewhere says, a man may brave
the censures of society, but a woman must accommodate
herself to them. She was thought to defy her
own nation, and they hurled the defiance back upon
her. She held in contempt the gentler qualities of
her own sex, who, in return, were not slow to resent
the masculine characteristics on which she presumed
to maintain her assumed position. She carried with
her from England the disposition to conciliate, by
kindness and forbearance, the fidelity and obedience
of her domestics: but she was eventually led into
undue harshness towards them, which became more
and more exaggerated in her by the idleness, the
ignorance, and irritating vices of her Eastern household.</p>

<p>Another important lesson may be gleaned from her
life. We have a favourable opportunity of observing,
in her example, how far the human understanding
may, by its own natural powers unassisted by books,
work its way to celebrity. Her intellects were so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
acute that she had little difficulty in comprehending
all the moral and political questions discussed in her
presence, and she consequently gathered information
from very superior sources, as she enjoyed the intimacy
of first-rate men. Still she had but narrow
views of general policy, of the rights of mankind, in
fine, of politics and ethics in the abstract; inasmuch
as the discussions, which were carried on before her,
were the debates of parties and sects, having immediate
reference merely to certain men and certain
questions, rather than presenting enlightened and
comprehensive considerations grounded on philosophical
principles. But it was here that her profound
knowledge of mankind came into play; and
this it was which impressed on her sayings and
counsels the stamp of pre-eminent sagacity. Intercourse
with the world, however, or even with cabinet
ministers, although it may render us accomplished
diplomatists, cannot make us statesmen, in the true
acceptation of the word—least of all can it make us
teachers and philosophers. We cannot solve a problem
in mathematics, unless we have previously traced
the steps which lead to it one by one; nor can we
ever arrive at precision on any subject until we have
mastered its elements and made ourselves acquainted
with the results of antecedent investigations. In
this, therefore, lay the grand defect of Lady Hester’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
education. She was not only wanting, as almost all
women are, in the philosophical power of generalization,
but her reading was literally so circumscribed,
that her deficiency in what may be called book-learning
often amounted to absolute ignorance. She said she
despised books; but it was simply because she was
never made aware how much valuable information
they contain. She trusted everything to intuitive
perception. Her constant denial of the utility of
study, founded on the conviction that education does
not alter men’s characters or change their innate
disposition, is wholly independent of that other proposition,
which recognizes knowledge as an edifice
seated on a height, to which we must climb step by
step, taking care that each fundamental truth, in the
ascent, shall be laid down with certainty, in order to
secure the solidity of the superincumbent materials.
She disowned alike the benefits of learning and the
necessity of the progressive acquisition of knowledge.
Her ladyship jumped to conclusions in perfect ignorance
of the researches and discoveries of previous
inquirers.</p>

<p>Lady Hester possessed none of the more graceful
accomplishments of her sex:—not from inability to
acquire them, for her remarks on music, painting, and
other fine arts, were always striking and apposite;
but because she preferred occupying her mind on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
matters more congenial to her peculiar tastes. It
cannot be doubted that she had all the opportunities
usually afforded to the children of the nobility for the
culture of the mind in liberal pursuits and attainments;
but she took no delight in such things, and only spoke
of them slightly and incidentally.</p>

<p>Popular opinion has ascribed the eccentricities of
Lady Hester Stanhope to a crazed brain:<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> it is not
for me to venture upon a question of so delicate a
nature. Lucius Junius Brutus was supposed to be
insane, and played the part of an idiot until the proper
time arrived for casting away the mask. Hamlet
enacts madness for a purpose: and some writers go so
far as to assert that Mahomet was insane, and that no
enthusiast of a high order can achieve his ends and
gain over proselytes to his views without a tincture of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
insanity. The dream of Lady Hester’s life was sway
and dominion—how to obtain the one or the other
was the difficulty; for she was born a subject, and
excluded by her sex from vice-royalties and governments:
with the genius of a hero, she could neither
take the command of fleets or armies, nor preside in
the councils of state. How far then she may have
contemplated the possibility of acquiring power by
endeavouring to establish a superstitious belief
amongst those around her, and, through them, over
a wider range, that she possessed supernatural gifts;
how far she may have tried to help out this design by
professing implicit faith in strange and absurd legends
and traditions, visions, and tales; and how far the
delusion, originally taken up for a purpose, may have
ultimately re-acted upon her own mind—these are
speculations which I leave to others; but, whilst I
decline, from motives of delicacy, and in deference to
the public, from whose award the decree must finally
come, to pronounce any opinion on Lady Hester Stanhope’s
perfect sanity, I do not feel myself precluded
from calling the reader’s attention to one striking
point of evidence in favour of it, which extends, like a
vein of pure ore, through the whole course of her
varied career.</p>

<p>I have depicted, somewhat minutely, and without
ostentation or disguise, her ladyship’s habitual deportment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
and language towards her visitors, her household,
and myself. I have introduced all those, who
have patiently followed me in these pages, into her
sanctuary; have let them join in her conversations;
have, as I hope, induced them to listen to her improbable
stories of witchcraft and astrology; and have
shared their incredulity in her supernatural mission:
but I would now invite them to weigh against these
seeming hallucinations the remarkable fact, that, in all
her epistolary correspondence, down to the close of her
life, not one aberration of intellect occurs. It is as if
she had said to herself—“Those who come to glean
ridicule from my words, and presume to fathom my
purposes, will I make fools of and confound: they
shall go away loaded with a cargo of their own
choosing, and shall retail countless absurdities in their
books to amuse the world for awhile: but, when the
time shall be accomplished, these absurdities shall
rebound on themselves; for I will challenge the most
diligent research to gather any from my writings, and
then, who will believe that I uttered them, except to
make the unworthy hearers ridiculous?” The fact is,
she may have spoken a great many strange things,
but she has written none. I am in possession of a
letter of hers, drawn up with attention on a very
serious subject in the very plenitude of her mental
powers; but I declare that it presents no superiority,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
either in style or composition, over the productions of
her later years: neither do her familiar letters, from
first to last, leave an opening for the most critical
caviller to say that, down to the day of her death, she
manifested any decline of reason, or disclosed one jot
less of that sound sense or those discriminating powers
which had made her the admiration of some of the
leading characters of her times. Her letter to the
Duke Maximilian of Bavaria breathes as much delicacy
of sentiment as if it had issued from her boudoir
in Downing Street: her condolence with the Beyrout
merchant is more profound in reasoning, though less
epigrammatic, than that of Servius Sulpicius to
Cicero on the death of his daughter Tullia; and
her appeal to the good feeling of her countrymen
against the uncalled-for interference of the Foreign
Office in her private affairs is inferior to no production
of our ablest combatants against the abuses of authority.</p>

<p>One point more remains to be touched upon. Lady
Hester Stanhope, the advocate of the divine right of
sovereigns, the stickler for the exclusive privileges of
the aristocracy, she, who treated with ineffable ridicule
and disdain the presumption of people, who, belonging
to the class of commoners, set up claims of equality
with the noble born, was herself weak enough to
betray irritation, and even resentment, towards that
still higher power in the state to which our allegiance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
is ever due. Of our beloved Queen, to whose sacred
majesty she did homage in the abstract, she could
not forbear speaking irreverently on many occasions.
The letter which she wrote to her Majesty, in reference
to the sequestration of her pension, was as
unpardonable in diction as it was unjustifiable in
substance. But great allowances are to be made for
her; and they alone, who know the trying circumstances
in which she was placed, can feel the full force of the
plea that might be alleged in mitigation of her offence.</p>

<p>My task is done:—it has been one of no ordinary
difficulty. I have had to undeceive the world respecting
the real life of a distinguished woman, who, in
her day, occupied a large share of its attention, and
whose ill-defined celebrity was based chiefly on the
accounts of travellers, written no doubt in good faith,
but in grievous ignorance of the truth. I have had
to remove the veil which shrouded her existence, to
disperse the imaginary attributes with which the
fancy of most readers had invested her, to dissipate
the splendour thrown over her retirement, and
to substitute unpleasant facts for Eastern fables.
Let it not be suspected that, in doing this, I have
overstepped the bounds of professional confidence or
violated the sacred intimacies of domestic life.</p>

<p>My object has been to vindicate the fame of a persecuted
lady, whose memory I honour, and most of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
whose actions have been misrepresented; and, in pursuing
this object with frankness and integrity, I have
only fulfilled a plain duty, imposed upon me by her
constant denunciations of the injustice which the
English had done to the purity of her motives—a
duty distinctly enjoined by her frequent appeals to me
that I should make public some circumstances of
her life, which might set them right, and correct
their judgment concerning her conduct. Using as
much as possible her own words (indeed I may say
<em>entirely</em>), I have unavoidably introduced the names of
many individuals yet alive, and of others but lately
removed from the scene of ambition, envy, and political
strife. The utmost delicacy consistent with the
utmost candour has been observed in a task which
presented such a dilemma of difficulties; and, if any
persons should feel hurt at any of the disclosures in
this work, I can assure them that, due regard being
had to the state of mental irritation to which wounded
feelings had brought Lady Hester Stanhope, they
will do no wrong in considering all the acrimonious
passages they may detect in these pages merely
as a scene out of “Timon of Athens”—a burst
of spleen against mankind, produced by a long series
of mortifications, wrongs, and disappointments.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_35" href="#FNanchor_35" class="label">[35]</a> This letter, and the letter to Lord Brougham, were intended
by Lady Hester Stanhope for publication in the newspapers
conjointly with the correspondence about her debts:
but the space, which so much matter would have occupied,
rendered it necessary to leave them out.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_36" href="#FNanchor_36" class="label">[36]</a> The adoption of the words “Sir Baron, Sir Count,” at the
beginning of letters, may appear to the reader quaint and ridiculous;
but these expressions are only verbal translations of
“Monsieur le Baron,” “Monsieur le Comte,” and less abrupt
than plain “Baron,” “Count.” Abroad, the prefix “Dear”
is not so lightly attached to a name as it is in England. I recollect,
some years ago, an Italian gentleman, Signor Guiseppe
Celi, proprietor of a marine villa on the Island of Palmaria, in
the Gulf of Spezzia, to have shown me a letter he had received
from an English gentleman, who had tenanted his house
for some months, and between whom and himself, as it appeared,
there existed a tolerable degree of intimacy, and his asking me
what I thought of Mr. B.’s addressing him <i>Caro</i> Signore. The
wary Italian seemed to imagine it was a term of friendship, to
which he was not entitled, and fancied he was about to be
wheedled out of something; he could not imagine it proceeded
from the writer’s good nature.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_45" href="#FNanchor_45" class="label">[45]</a> “A group of Bedouins were disputing respecting the sanity
of Lady Hester Stanhope; one party strenuously maintaining
that it was impossible a lady so charitable, so munificent, could
be otherwise than in full possession of her faculties; their opponents
alleging that her assimilating herself to the Virgin
Mary, her anticipated entry with our Saviour into Jerusalem,
and other vagaries attributed to her, were proofs to the contrary.
An old man with a white beard called for silence (a
call from the aged amidst the Arabs seldom made in vain.)
‘She is mad,’ said he; and, lowering his voice to a whisper, as
if fearing lest such an outrage against established custom should
spread beyond his circle, he added, ‘for she puts sugar in her
coffee.’”—<cite>Travels in Arabia, by Lieutenant Welsted, F.A.S.</cite>

<h3>Transcriber’s Note:</h3>
</div>

<p>This book was written in a period when many words had not become
standardized in their spelling. Words may have multiple spelling
variations or inconsistent hyphenation in the text. These have been
left unchanged unless indicated below. Obsolete and alternative
spellings were left unchanged.</p>

<p>Footnotes were renumbered sequentially and were moved to
the end of the chapter. Obvious printing errors, such as backwards,
reversed, upside down, or partially printed letters and punctuation
were corrected. Final stops missing at the end of sentences and
abbreviations were added. Duplicate words and letters at line endings
or page breaks were removed. Quote marks, accents and parentheses were
adjusted to standard usage.</p>

<p>In the index, there are numerous entries without corresponding volume
or page numbers. There are additional entries with volume and page
numbers that do not match the book.</p>

<p>The following were changed:</p>
<ul>
